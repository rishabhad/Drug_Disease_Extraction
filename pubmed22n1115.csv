0,20868729,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt-7a are morphogens involved in embryonic as well as ongoing adult neurogenesis. Their effects on the differentiation and membrane properties of neonatal neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) were studied in vitro using NS/PCs transduced with either Shh or Wnt-7a. Eight days after the onset of in vitro differentiation the cells were analyzed for the expression of neuronal and glial markers using immunocytochemical and Western blot analysis, and their membrane properties were characterized using the patch-clamp technique. Our results showed that both Shh and Wnt-7a increased the numbers of cells expressing neuronal markers; however, quantitative immunocytochemical analysis showed that only Wnt-7a enhanced the outgrowth and the development of processes in these cells. In addition, Wnt-7a markedly suppressed gliogenesis. The electrophysiological analysis revealed that Wnt-7a increased, while Shh decreased the incidence of cells displaying a neuron-like current pattern, represented by outwardly rectifying K(+) currents and tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na(+) currents. Additionally, Wnt-7a increased cell proliferation only at the early stages of differentiation, while Shh promoted proliferation within the entire course of differentiation. Thus we can conclude that Shh and Wnt-7a interfere differently with the process of neuronal differentiation and that they promote distinct stages of neuronal differentiation in neonatal NS/PCs."

2,19756885,"Cardiac tissue-engineering research is focused on the development of functional three-dimensional (3D) heart muscle in vitro. These models allow the detailed study of critical events in organogenesis, such as the establishment of cell-cell communication and construction and modification of the extracellular matrix. We have previously described a model for 3D heart muscle, termed cardioids, formed by the spontaneous delamination of a cohesive monolayer of primary cells in the absence of any synthetic scaffolding material. In an earlier publication, we have shown that, upon electrical stimulation, cardioids generate a twitch force in the range of 200-300 microN, generate a specific force (twitch force normalized to total cross-sectional area) of 2-4 kN/m(2), and can be electrically paced at frequencies of up to 10 Hz without any notable fatigue. We have two objectives for the current study: model development and model optimization. Our model development efforts are focused on providing additional characterization of the cardioid model. In this study, we show for the first time that cardioids show a pattern of gene expression comparable to that of cells cultured in two dimensions on tissue culture plastic and normal mammalian heart muscle. Compared with primary cardiac cells cultured on tissue culture plastic, the expression of alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC), beta-MHC, SERCA2, and phospholamban was significantly higher in cardioids. Our second objective, model optimization, is focused on evaluating the effect of several cell culture variables on cardioid formation and function. Specifically, we looked at the effect of plating density (1.0-4.0 x 10(6) cells per cardioid), concentration of two adhesion proteins (laminin at 0.2-2.0 microg/cm(2) and fibronectin at 1-10 microg/cm(2)), myocyte purity (using preplating times of 15 and 60 min), and ascorbic acid stimulation (1-100 microl/ml). For our optimization studies, we utilized twitch force in response to electrical stimulation as our endpoint metric. Based on these studies, we found that cardioids formed with a plating density in the range 3-4 x 10(6) cells per cardioid generated the maximum twitch force, whereas increasing the surface adhesion protein (using either laminin or fibronectin) and increasing the myocyte purity both resulted in a decrease in twitch force. In addition, increasing the ascorbic acid concentration resulted in an increase in the baseline force of cardioids, which was recorded in the absence of electrical stimulation. Based on the model development studies, we have shown that cardioids do indeed exhibit a gene expression pattern similar to normal mammalian heart muscle. This provides further validity for the cardioid model. Based on the model optimization studies, we have identified specific cell culture regimes which support cardioid formation and function. These results are specific to the cardioid model; however, they may be translated and applied to other tissue-engineering models. Collectively, the work described in this study provides insight into the formation of functional 3D heart muscle and the effect of several cell culture variables on tissue formation and function."

4,21480395,"Tobacco is notably genotoxic and associated with head and neck carcinogenesis. Cigarette carcinogens have the capacity to alter early response gene expression in tobacco-related malignancies via genes such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB). A number of early response gene activation events are also facilitated by fos/jun activator protein 1 (AP-1) associated pathways. In the present study, we hypothesize that tobacco products may induce microenvironment alterations, promoting angiogenesis and providing a permissive environment for head and neck cancer progression. In an in vitro analysis, we employed immortalized oral keratinocyte (HOK-16B) and laryngeal squamous carcinoma (UM-SCC-11A) cells to investigate interleukin (IL)-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induction by cigarette smoke condensate (CSC). IL-8 and VEGF expression is based on interactions between NFκB, AP-1, and NF-IL6. We identified at least 1.5-fold dose-dependent induction of AP-1, VEGF, and IL-8 promoter/reporter gene activity after 24 h exposure to CSC. Next, we stably transfected UM-SCC-11A cells with A-Fos, a dominant negative AP-1 protein. Treatment with CSC of the A-Fos cell lines compared to empty vector controls significantly down-regulated AP-1, VEGF, and IL-8 promoter/reporter gene expression. We also performed ELISAs and discovered significant up-regulation of IL-8 and VEGF secretion by UMSCC 11A after treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and CSC, which was down-regulated by the A-Fos dominant negative protein. We conclude tobacco carcinogens up-regulate AP-1 activity and AP-1 dependent IL-8 and VEGF gene expression in head and neck cancer. This up-regulation may promote an angiogenic phenotype favoring invasion in both premalignant and squamous cancer cells of the head and neck."

6,24182692,"There is not much level 1 evidence based literature to guide management of hypertrophic scars and keloids despite an array of therapeutic modalities at disposal. Intralesional (i/l) triamcinolone injections have remained a gold standard in non surgical management. Sporadic reports on use of i/l verapamil suggest its efficacy. Since verapamil has not found sufficient mention as an effective alternative modality, it was decided to undertake a randomized study which could also address some additional clinical parameters. A randomized, parallel group and observer blinded comparison with 40 patients (48 scars) was carried out to compare the effects of i/l triamcinolone (T) (22 scars) and verapamil injections (V) (26 scars). 1.5 ml was the maximum indicative volume decided in the study protocol for both the drugs (triamcinolone @40 mg/ml and verapamil @ 2.5 mg/ml). Patients included were aged between 15-60 years with scars ranging between 0.5-5 cm (but total area roughly <6 cm(2)), and scars under 2 years duration. Patients with keloidal diathesis were excluded. Injections were scheduled every three weeks until complete flattening of the scar or eight sessions, which ever came earlier. No concomitant therapies like massage, silicone gel or pressure garments were used. Scar evaluation at each stage was done by serial photographic records as well as by Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). Comparative survival analysis between the two drugs was done using Kaplan Meier curves, and VSS scores were analyzed using Wilcoxon test and log rank test. Mean zero VSS scores were achieved with treatments in respect of scar height (T-12 weeks, V-21 weeks), vascularity (T-15 weeks, V-18 weeks) and pliability (T-15 weeks, V-21 weeks). The improvement in scar vascularity and pliability kept pace with decrease in scar height, in both the groups. There was not much difference in the rate of change of scar pigmentation with either drug but almost 60% patients in both the groups regained normal pigmentation. Our study adds to evidence of verapamil's capability in flattening the raised scars. With an extremely low cost and fewer adverse effects it deserves better positioning in the wide armamentarium against hypertrophic scars. It also offers several therapeutic possibilities to alternate with triamcinolone or be used simultaneously in larger (or multiple) scars."

37,26801659,"Ovarian cancer is the third most common gynaecological cancer worldwide, with an age-standardised incidence rate of 6.1 per 10,000 women. Standard therapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) includes a combination of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Cytoreductive surgery aims to remove as much of the visible tumour as possible. As extensive intraperitoneal metastases are typical of advanced EOC, cytoreductive surgery is usually an extensive procedure with the risk of excessive bleeding. Tranexamic acid given perioperatively is effective in reducing blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion requirements in a variety of surgical settings. Therefore, tranexamic acid seems to be a promising agent for minimising blood loss and the need for blood transfusion among women with advanced EOC undergoing cytoreductive surgery."

The majority of tumours arise from surface of the ovary (epithelial). Two thirds of these women will present with advanced disease, requiring aggressive treatment, which includes debulking surgery (removal of as much disease as possible) and chemotherapy. However, most women (75%) with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) will relapse following surgery and chemotherapy. Patients who relapse are treated with either platinum or non-platinum drugs and this is dependent on the platinum-sensitivity and platinum-free interval. These drug regimens are generally well-tolerated although there are potential severe side effects. New treatments that can be used to treat recurrence or prevent disease progression after first-line or subsequent chemotherapy are important, especially those with a low toxicity profile.

While some studies reported a genetic distinction between Northern and Southern Han Chinese, others showed a more clinal picture of small differences within China. Here, we investigated the distribution of Y chromosome variation along administrative as well as ethnic divisions in the mainland territory of the People's Republic of China, including 28 administrative regions and 19 recognized Chinese nationalities, to assess the impact of recent demographic processes. To this end, we analyzed 37,994 Y chromosomal 17-marker haplotype profiles from the YHRD database with respect to forensic diversity measures and genetic distance between groups defined by administrative boundaries and ethnic origin. We observed high diversity throughout all Chinese provinces and ethnicities. Some ethnicities, including most prominently Kazakhs and Tibetans, showed significant genetic differentiation from the Han and other groups. However, differences between provinces were, except for those located on the Tibetan plateau, less pronounced. This discrepancy is explicable by the sizeable presence of Han speakers, who showed high genetic homogeneity all across China, in nearly all studied provinces. Furthermore, we observed a continuous genetic North-South gradient in the Han, confirming previous reports of a clinal distribution of Y chromosome variation and being in notable concordance with the previously observed spatial distribution of autosomal variation.

66,28601047,"Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous and chronic airway inflammatory disease with different clinical phenotypes caused by diverse triggers and pathophysiological mechanisms. Asthma heritability has been established in many genetic studies but it is evident that only genetic elements are not responsible for the development of asthma. Increasing rate of asthma incidence during past decades has implicated the role of epigenetics in development of asthma. Environmental factors perform as initiator signals through epigenetic mechanisms. Three epigenetic mechanisms have been identified, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and small noncoding RNAs. These mechanisms regulate the immune responses and inflammatory genes expression in asthma and allergy. This review explains the role of epigenetic modifications in controlling Th2 response and IgE production in asthma and also briefly overviews the role of environmental factors such as pollutions, allergens, prenatal exposures and diet in developing asthma. Recognizing environmental risk factors and their effects on epigenetic mechanisms would be of great interest for prognostic and preventive aspect in treatment of asthma."

Occurrence of DCI, Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) score of < 26, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 3-6 were considered poor clinical outcomes. Non-linear regression analysis detected a transition between periods of rising and declining coated-platelet levels at day 4. Additional regression analyses of coated-platelet trends before day 4 showed differences among patients with modified Fisher 3-4 [4.2% per day (95% CI 2.4, 6.1) vs. - 0.8% per day (95% CI - 3.4, 1.8); p = 0.0023] and those developing DCI [4.6% per day (95% CI 2.8, 6.5) vs. - 1.9% per day (95% CI - 4.5, 0.5); p < 0.001]. Differences between peak coated-platelet levels and baseline levels were larger, on average for those with DCI [18.1 ± 9.6 vs. 10.6 ± 8.0; p = 0.03], MOCA < 26 [17.0 ± 7.8 vs. 10.7 ± 7.4; p = 0.05] and mRS 3-6 [24.8 ± 10.5 vs. 11.9 ± 7.6; p = 0.01]. Coated-platelet trends after aSAH predict DCI and short-term clinical outcomes. The degree of rise in coated-platelets is also associated with adverse clinical outcomes."
72,29107330,"Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer. Losing the ability to present neoantigens through human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loss may facilitate immune evasion. However, the polymorphic nature of the locus has precluded accurate HLA copy-number analysis. Here, we present loss of heterozygosity in human leukocyte antigen (LOHHLA), a computational tool to determine HLA allele-specific copy number from sequencing data. Using LOHHLA, we find that HLA LOH occurs in 40% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and is associated with a high subclonal neoantigen burden, APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis, upregulation of cytolytic activity, and PD-L1 positivity. The focal nature of HLA LOH alterations, their subclonal frequencies, enrichment in metastatic sites, and occurrence as parallel events suggests that HLA LOH is an immune escape mechanism that is subject to strong microenvironmental selection pressures later in tumor evolution. Characterizing HLA LOH with LOHHLA refines neoantigen prediction and may have implications for our understanding of resistance mechanisms and immunotherapeutic approaches targeting neoantigens.

74,29274354,"Ochratoxin A (OTA), a common mycotoxin found in nature, has been implicated as effecting the function of male reproductive systems. OTA exposure has been shown to decrease sperm production and quality, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In the current investigation boar sperm exposed to 10 and 100μM OTA in vitro for 24h resulted in significantly decreased motility, in the 100μM OTA treatment group when compared with the control group. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was significantly increased in both of the OTA treatment groups. The increase in ROS activated phosphatase and the tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) and inhibited the activation of protein kinase B (PKB, AKT), activated adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), and activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the exposed sperm. Furthermore, activation of AMPK was enhanced by a decrease in ATPase. These changes culminated in a decline in boar sperm motility. PTEN/AMPK inhibitors significantly inhibited the expression of the two proteins in the OTA treatment group. In addition, there was increased expression of apoptosis markers in the OTA exposed sperm. In conclusion, these data suggest that OTA exposure affects the sperm motility via the AMPK and PTEN signaling pathways."

77,29535826,"Following treatment 40% of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients suffer disease recurrence. In certain cancers circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumour-derived DNA (ctDNA) characteristics correlate closely with disease burden, making them exciting potential sources of biomarkers. Despite this, the circulating nucleic acid characteristics of only 2 STS patients have been reported to date. To address this we used an Ion AmpliSeq™ panel custom specifically designed for STS patients to conduct a genetic characterisation of plasma cfDNA, buffy coat (germline) DNA and where available Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) primary STS tissue DNA in a cohort of 11 metastatic STS patients. We found that total cfDNA levels were significantly elevated in the STS patients analysed, and weakly correlated with disease burden. Using our Ion AmpliSeq™ panel we also successfully detected ctDNA in 4/11 (36%) patients analysed with a wide variety of STS subtypes and disease burdens. This evidence included the presence of cancer associated "
78,29601981,"Personal space, defined as the distance individuals choose to maintain between themselves and others, is an indicator of affiliation and closeness. Most paradigms that measure personal space preferences involve explicit choice and therefore fail to examine the implicit aspects of such preferences. In the current study, we sought to investigate an implicit form of interpersonal space that is more closely related to real-life situations involving affiliation. We studied the effects of oxytocin (OT) on neural networks that involve affiliation and tested the impact on personal space preferences. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, we asked participants to choose between two rooms that differed only in the distances between two stimuli. The stimuli were either social stimuli (two chairs) or non-social stimuli (table and plant). The behavioral results showed that OT caused participants to choose a closer space in social blocks but did not affect their choices in non-social blocks. Imaging results revealed an interaction between stimulus and treatment (OT/PL) in the dorsal striatum, an area that is related to approach motivation and is part of the reward circuitry. Specifically, OT increased activity in the dorsal striatum in the social blocks and decreased this activity in the non-social blocks. The results of the study strengthen the social salience theory regarding OT, indicating that OT does not uniformly affect all social responses and that context has a determining impact on our behavior."
79,29635140,"Iran is currently discussing cannabis and opium regulations, which could bring a legalisation of drug consumption through a state supervised system. The article engages with the question of cannabis by looking at the legal interpretation of religious authorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The choice of Iran is justified for several reasons: firstly, Iran has a long history of drug use and cannabis has been part of the country's intoxicant traditions since times immemorial; secondly, the Iranian state is unique in that it combines religious exegesis with political machination through official channels; finally, among all Middle East and Islamic countries, Iran is at the avant-garde in experimenting in the field of drugs policy which makes an excellent case for the study of cannabis regulation. The article is the result of a direct engagement with Iran's leading Shi'a authorities, the maraje'-e taqlid, 'source of emulation'. The authors redacted a list of eight questions (estefta'at) about the status of cannabis in Iranian society. It questioned cannabis' legality in Islam, its potential medical use, the feasibility of domestic production and other relevant aspects of its social-religious life. Based on the responses, the authors analysed the difference in opinions among the religious scholars and speculate on the possibility of policy reform. Given the dearth of scholarly work about illicit drugs in the Islamic world, about which many readers might not be familiar, the article opens with an overview of the place of cannabis in the history of Islamic societies. It discusses terminological ambiguities, references in religious texts and traditions, and the general interpretations within Muslim religious schools of thought. Then, it discusses the status of cannabis in contemporary Iran before tackling the responses provided by the religious scholars. Eventually, the paper puts forward reflections about the potential implications for future policy developments on cannabis."

However, the role of circRNA in malignant melanoma has not been reported. In this study, human circRNA microarray was used to screen the dysregulated circRNA in melanoma. We found that circRNA_0084043 was significantly up-regulated in melanoma tissue, and the result was replicated in a larger sample size. High circRNA_0084043 expression was an independent risk factor of overall survival in melanoma patients. circRNA_0084043 promotes melanoma cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that circRNA_0084043 directly binds to miR-153-3p, and Snail is directly targeted by miR-153-3p. We also demonstrated that circRNA_0084043 may act as the sponge of miR-153-3p to up-regulate Snail expression, and consequently function as an oncogene in melanoma. Overall, this result elucidates a new mechanism for circRNA_0084043 in melanoma development and provides a potential therapeutic target for melanoma patients."

90,30002145,"Rivaroxaban is an effective and safe alternative to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. We tested the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in high-risk patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. This is a randomized open-label multicenter noninferiority study with blinded end point adjudication. Rivaroxaban, 20 mg once daily (15 mg once daily based on kidney function) was compared with warfarin (international normalized ratio target 2.5) for the prevention of thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and vascular death in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. Only high-risk patients triple positive for lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin, and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies of the same isotype (triple positivity) were included in the study. The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrollment of 120 patients (59 randomized to rivaroxaban and 61 to warfarin) because of an excess of events among patients in the rivaroxaban arm. Mean follow-up was 569 days. There were 11 (19%) events in the rivaroxaban group, and 2 (3%) events in the warfarin group. Thromboembolic events occurred in 7 (12%) patients randomized to rivaroxaban (4 ischemic stroke and 3 myocardial infarction), whereas no event was recorded in those randomized to warfarin. Major bleeding occurred in 6 patients: 4 (7%) in the rivaroxaban group and 2 (3%) in the warfarin group. No death was reported. The use of rivaroxaban in high-risk patients with antiphospholipid syndrome was associated with an increased rate of events compared with warfarin, thus showing no benefit and excess risk.

We reviewed the literature focusing on the relationship between the microbiome and cancer, as well as the relationship between gynecologic diseases and cancers. The human body contains different kinds of microorganisms in various body parts, which is termed the microbiome. The number of microorganisms that live in and on the human body is greater than that of the human germ and somatic cells by 10-fold. The relationship between a human and their microbiome is complex; it is also one of the most important components of homeostasis. Impairment of microbiome-host homeostasis has been associated with obesity, several cancers, preterm labor, inflammatory and allergic conditions and neurodevelopmental disorders. Direct and strong causal relationships have been established for several cancers and microorganisms, such as gastric lymphoma and Helicobacter pylori infection. Interestingly, eradication of the infectious agents has also been shown to be therapeutic. The association between cancer and the microbiome, however, is more complicated than a 1 bacteria-1 cancer model, and a shift in a healthy microbiome can result in various cancers via inflammation, change in microenvironment or DNA-damaging toxins. The human microbiome is an integral part of homeostasis. Understanding the mechanisms that cause dysbiosis will enable us to elucidate the pathways that result in malignancy and investigate new treatment modalities."

95,30103859,"Solubility is a crucial physicochemical property for drug candidates and is important in both drug discovery and development. Poor solubility is detrimental to absorption after oral administration and can mask compound activity in bioassays in various ways. Hence, solubility liabilities should ideally be identified as early as possible in the drug development process. With the increasing number of compounds as potential drug candidates, automated thermodynamic solubility assays for high throughput screening enabling rapid evaluation of a large number of compounds are becoming increasingly important. This review discusses the current status of the most widely used automated assays for thermodynamic solubility, followed by recent high throughput measurements of properties related to solubility (e.g. dissolution rate and supersaturation) and a brief overview of predictive computational methods for thermodynamic solubility reported in the literature."

In contrast, thermodynamic solubility methods show a clear evolution: miniaturized high throughput assays coupled to analytical techniques such as solid-state characterization, ultra performance liquid chromatography, or polychromatic turbidimetry, have been developed, thereby enabling a more complex physicochemical profiling at the early discovery stage. Solubility prediction still poses a significant challenge at the industrial level. Classification and critical evaluation of recent in silico models are provided.

97,30166531,"Improving early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) is a key public health priority as adenomas and stage I cancer can be treated with minimally invasive procedures. Population screening strategies based on detection of occult blood in the feces have contributed to enhance detection rates of localized disease, but new approaches based on genetic analyses able to increase specificity and sensitivity could provide additional advantages compared to current screening methodologies. Recently, circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has received much attention as a cancer biomarker for its ability to monitor the progression of advanced disease, predict tumor recurrence and reflect the complex genetic heterogeneity of cancers. Here, we tested whether analysis of cfDNA is a viable tool to enhance detection of colon adenomas. To address this, we assessed a cohort of patients with adenomas and healthy controls using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and mutation-specific assays targeted to trunk mutations. Additionally, we performed multiregional, targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of adenomas and unmasked extensive heterogeneity, affecting known drivers such as APC, KRAS and mismatch repair (MMR) genes. However, tumor-related mutations were undetectable in patients' plasma. Finally, we employed a preclinical mouse model of Apc-driven intestinal adenomas and confirmed the inability to identify tumor-related alterations via cfDNA, despite the enhanced disease burden displayed by this experimental cancer model. Therefore, we conclude that benign colon lesions display extensive genetic heterogeneity, that they are not prone to release DNA into the circulation and are unlikely to be reliably detected with liquid biopsies, at least with the current technologies."
98,30170195,"While tissue form and function is highly dependent upon tissue-specific collagen composition and organization, little is known of the mechanisms controlling the bundling of collagen fibrils into fibers and larger structural designs that lead to the formation of bones, tendons and other tissues. Using the cornea as a model system, our previous 3 dimensional mapping of collagen fiber organization has demonstrated that macrostructural organization of collagen fibers involving interweaving, branching and anastomosing plays a critical role in controlling mechanical stiffness, corneal shape and refractive power. In this work, the cellular and mechanical mechanisms regulating critical events in the assembly of collagen macrostructure are analysed in the developing chicken cornea. We elucidated the temporal events leading to adult corneal structure and determined the effects of intraocular pressure (IOP) on the organization of the collagen macrostructure. Our findings indicate that the complex adult collagen organization begins to appear on embryonic day 10 (E10) after deposition of the primary stroma and full invasion of keratocytes. Importantly, organizational changes in keratocytes appearing at E9 preceded and predicted later changes in collagen organization. Corneal collagen organization remained unaffected when the development of IOP was blocked at E4. These findings support a primary role for keratocytes in controlling stromal organization, mechanical stiffness and corneal shape that are not regulated by the IOP. Our findings also suggest that the avian cornea represents an excellent experimental model for elucidating key regulatory steps and mechanisms controlling the collagen fiber organization that is critical to determining tissue form and function."

105,30456377,"During B-cell activation, the dynamic reorganisation of the cytoskeleton is crucial for multiple cellular responses, such as receptor signalling, cell spreading, antigen internalisation, intracellular trafficking, and antigen presentation. However, the role of intermediate filaments (IFs), which represent a major component of the mammalian cytoskeleton, is not well defined. Here, by using multiple super-resolution microscopy techniques, including direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, we show that IFs in B cells undergo drastic reorganisation immediately upon antigen stimulation and that this reorganisation requires actin and microtubules. Although the loss of vimentin in B cells did not impair B-cell development, receptor signalling, and differentiation, vimentin-deficient B cells exhibit altered positioning of antigen-containing and lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1"

110,30514977,"Most cancer-related deaths are a result of metastasis, and thus the importance of this process as a target of therapy cannot be understated. By asking 'how can we effectively treat cancer?', we do not capture the complexity of a disease encompassing >200 different cancer types - many consisting of multiple subtypes - with considerable intratumoural heterogeneity, which can result in variable responses to a specific therapy. Moreover, we have much less information on the pathophysiological characteristics of metastases than is available for the primary tumour. Most disseminated tumour cells that arrive in distant tissues, surrounded by unfamiliar cells and a foreign microenvironment, are likely to die; however, those that survive can generate metastatic tumours with a markedly different biology from that of the primary tumour. To treat metastasis effectively, we must inhibit fundamental metastatic processes and develop specific preclinical and clinical strategies that do not rely on primary tumour responses. To address this crucial issue, Cancer Research UK and Cancer Therapeutics CRC Australia formed a Metastasis Working Group with representatives from not-for-profit, academic, government, industry and regulatory bodies in order to develop recommendations on how to tackle the challenges associated with treating (micro)metastatic disease. Herein, we describe the challenges identified as well as the proposed approaches for discovering and developing anticancer agents designed specifically to prevent or delay the metastatic outgrowth of cancer."
111,30664665,"Regulatory T (Treg) cells control self-tolerance, inflammatory responses and tissue homeostasis. In mature Treg cells, continued expression of FOXP3 maintains lineage identity, while T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and interleukin-2 (IL-2)/STAT5 activation support the suppressive effector function of Treg cells, but how these regulators synergize to control Treg cell homeostasis and function remains unclear. Here we show that TCR-activated posttranslational modification by O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) stabilizes FOXP3 and activates STAT5, thus integrating these critical signaling pathways. O-GlcNAc-deficient Treg cells develop normally but display modestly reduced FOXP3 expression, strongly impaired lineage stability and effector function, and ultimately fatal autoimmunity in mice. Moreover, deficiency in protein O-GlcNAcylation attenuates IL-2/STAT5 signaling, while overexpression of a constitutively active form of STAT5 partially ameliorates Treg cell dysfunction and systemic inflammation in O-GlcNAc deficient mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that protein O-GlcNAcylation is essential for lineage stability and effector function in Treg cells."
112,30694220,"Soluble stimulation-2 (ST2) is increased during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), while Tregs that express ST2 prevent GVHD through unknown mechanisms. Transplantation of Foxp3- T cells and Tregs that were collected and sorted from different Foxp3 reporter mice indicated that in mice that developed GVHD, ST2+ Tregs were thymus derived and predominantly localized to the intestine. ST2-/- Treg transplantation was associated with reduced total intestinal Treg frequency and activation. ST2-/- versus WT intestinal Treg transcriptomes showed decreased Treg functional markers and, reciprocally, increased Rorc expression. Rorc-/- T cells transplantation enhanced the frequency and function of intestinal ST2+ Tregs and reduced GVHD through decreased gut-infiltrating soluble ST2-producing type 1 and increased IL-4/IL-10-producing type 2 T cells. Cotransfer of ST2+ Tregs sorted from Rorc-/- mice with WT CD25-depleted T cells decreased GVHD severity and mortality, increased intestinal ST2+KLRG1+ Tregs, and decreased type 1 T cells after transplantation, indicating an intrinsic mechanism. Ex vivo IL-33-stimulated Tregs (TregIL-33) expressed higher amphiregulin and displayed better immunosuppression, and adoptive transfer prevented GVHD better than control Tregs or TregIL-33 cultured with IL-23/IL-17. Amphiregulin blockade by neutralizing antibody in vivo abolished the protective effect of TregIL-33. Our data show that inverse expression of ST2 and RORγt in intestinal Tregs determines GVHD and that TregIL-33 has potential as a cellular therapy avenue for preventing GVHD."
113,30705058,"Follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells are a regulatory T cell subset that controls antibody production by inhibiting T follicular helper (Tfh)-mediated help to B cells. Tfh and Tfr cells possess opposing functions suggesting unique programming. Here we elucidated the transcriptional program controlling Tfr suppressive function. We found that Tfr cells have a program for suppressive function fine-tuned by tissue microenvironment. The transcription factor FoxP3 and chromatin-modifying enzyme EZH2 are essential for this transcriptional program but regulate the program in distinct ways. FoxP3 modifies the Tfh program to induce a Tfr-like functional state, demonstrating that Tfr cells coopt the Tfh program for suppression. Importantly, we identified a Tfr cell population that loses the Tfr program to become ""ex-Tfr"" cells with altered functionality. These dysfunctional ex-Tfr cells may have roles in modulating pathogenic antibody responses. Taken together, our studies reveal mechanisms controlling the Tfr transcriptional program and how failure of these mechanisms leads to dysfunctional Tfr cells."

115,30779693,"One of the largest sources of data on radiation exposure in humans is the study of the atomic bomb survivors at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan performed by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF). As part of their retrospective dosimetry efforts for the atomic bomb survivors, RERF published two core systems: Dosimetry System 1986 (DS86) and Dosimetry System 2002 (DS02). Due to computing limitations at the time, only three stylized phantoms (an infant, child and adult) were used in DS86 and DS02 to represent the entire Japanese population. In this study, we sought to evaluate the dosimetric differences that should be expected from using an updated and age-expanded phantom series with the survivor cohort. To this end, we developed a new series of hybrid phantoms, based on the Japanese population of 1945, which has greater anatomical realism and improved age resolution over those used by RERF. These phantoms were converted to voxel format and compared to their older counterparts through the calculation of organ dose coefficients using DS02 free-in-air particle fluences at three distances from the bomb hypocenter. From the photon portion of the spectra, organ dose differences of up to nearly 25% are expected between the old and new series, while organ dose differences of up to nearly 70% are expected from the neutron portion. We also compared organ dose coefficients among themselves to determine the accuracy in the use of one organ dose as the epidemiological surrogate to another.

118,30869654,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key modulators of inflammation and are important for the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. Adoptive immunotherapy with polyclonal Tregs holds promise in organ transplantation, graft-versus-host disease, and autoimmune diseases, but may be enhanced by antigen-specific, long-lived Treg cells. We modified primary human Tregs with chimeric antigen-receptors (CARs) bearing different costimulatory domains and performed in vitro analyses of their phenotype and function. While neither the presence of a CAR nor the type of costimulation domain influenced Foxp3 expression in Tregs, the costimulation domain of the CARs affected CAR Treg surface phenotype and functions such as cytokine production. Furthermore, signaling from the CD28 costimulation domain maintained CAR Treg suppressor function, whereas 4-1B costimulation did not. In vivo, CAR Tregs accumulated at sites expressing target antigen, and suppressed antigen specific effector T cell responses; however, only CAR Tregs with CD28 signaling domains were potent inhibitors of effector T cell mediated graft rejection in vivo. Our findings support the use of CD28 based CAR-Tregs for tissue specific immune suppression in the clinic."

The rates of infection and community epidemiology of respiratory viruses in healthy children needs further definition to assist interpretation of molecular diagnostic assays in this population. Children otherwise healthy aged 1 to 8 years were prospectively enrolled in the study during two consecutive winters, when ARIs peak in New Zealand. Parents completed a daily symptom diary for 8 weeks, during which time they collected a nasal swab from the child for each clinical ARI episode. A further nasal swab was collected by research staff during a clinic visit at the conclusion of the study. All samples were tested for 15 respiratory viruses commonly causing ARI using molecular multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays. There were 575 ARIs identified from 301 children completing the study, at a rate of 1.04 per child-month. Swabs collected during an ARI were positive for a respiratory virus in 76.8% (307 of 400), compared with 37.3% (79 of 212) of swabs collected during asymptomatic periods. The most common viruses detected were human rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza viruses, influenzavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus. All of these were significantly more likely to be detected during ARIs than asymptomatic periods. Parent-administered surveillance is a useful mechanism for understanding infectious disease in healthy children in the community. Interpretation of molecular diagnostic assays for viruses must be informed by understanding of local rates of asymptomatic infection by such viruses."

134,31099685,"For women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, the goal of surgery is to achieve a maximal, if not complete, cytoreduction. In cases when this is not possible, whether because of the extent of disease or patient-specific reasons, neoadjuvant chemotherapy using a platinum-based combination (on a typical every-2-week schedule) is often recommended. After neoadjuvant therapy and surgery, women proceed with additional adjuvant chemotherapy, which is typically given in a similar fashion to what was done in the preoperative setting. The question remains as to whether this is the optimal strategy, particularly in light of other data suggesting the use of an alternative regimen in the adjuvant context might yield a survival advantage. In this article, we review the outcomes of randomized trials that compared primary debulking to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and contemporary neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials that incorporated a novel schedule or regimen for testing in the adjuvant setting, including both intraperitoneal and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy. We describe our center's approach to these data, and we conclude that both options should be considered for women with ovarian cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy."
135,31166170,"Since the discovery of cyclic dimeric guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (c-di-GMP) in 1987, the role of cyclic dinucleotides in signal pathways has been extensively studied. Many receptors and effectors of cyclic dinucleotides have been identified which play important roles in cellular processes. Example of such effectors include cyclic dimeric adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (c-di-AMP)-binding proteins and endoplasmic reticulum membrane adaptor. Accumulating evidence indicate that cyclic dinucleotides act as second messengers that not only regulate the bacterial physiological processes but also affect host immune responses during infections. Streptococci species, which produce cyclic dinucleotides, are responsible for many human diseases. Numerous studies suggest that the cyclic dinucleotides are vital in signal transduction pathways as second messengers and influence the progression of infectious diseases. Here, we provide an overview of the molecular principles of cyclic dinucleotides synthesis and degradation and discuss recent progress on streptococcal signal transduction pathways by cyclic dinucleotide second messengers and their role in regulating host immune reaction. This review will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of streptococcal cyclic dinucleotide second messengers thereby revealing novel targets for preventing infections."
136,31170216,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are required for the maintenance of immune tolerance and adoptive Treg infusion therapy has become a promising approach to suppress immune responses in diseases such as autoimmunity and transplant rejection. However, one critical challenge of Treg therapy is the requirement of in vitro expansion of functionally stable Tregs while preventing either the contamination of T effector and/or emergence of unstable pathogenic Tregs. Recent studies showing distinct metabolic requirements of T effectors and Tregs suggest that manipulation of cell metabolism may be an attractive strategy to achieve this goal. Here we show that human thymically derived Tregs (tTregs) and in vitro induced Tregs (iTregs) from naive T cells engage glycolysis equivalently upon activation. However, inhibiting glucose metabolism via 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) has distinct effects on each of these subsets. While 2DG treatment at the onset of activation significantly reduced the proliferation and expression of suppressive molecules such as ICOS and CTLA-4 in tTregs, its effect on FOXP3 expression was small. In contrast, 2DG treatment during iTreg induction modestly decreased their proliferation but strongly reduced both ICOS and FOXP3 expression. Importantly, both Treg subsets became insensitive to 2DG after day 3 post activation with little effect on either proliferation or FOXP3 expression while T conventional Th0 cells showed reduced proliferation under the same conditions. Moreover, 2DG treatment at day 3 did not impair the suppressive capabilities of Treg subsets. Collectively, these findings suggest that there is a distinct temporal requirement of glycolysis in each of the activated human Treg subsets and T conventional cells. Furthermore, 2DG treatment at the onset as a strategy to impair contaminating T effector cell proliferation is unfavorable for optimal Treg generation as well."
137,31182480,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the most serious complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Notch signals delivered during the first 48 h after transplantation drive proinflammatory cytokine production in conventional T cells (Tconv) and inhibit the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Short-term Notch inhibition induces long-term GVHD protection. However, it remains unknown whether Notch blockade blunts GVHD through its effects on Tconv, Tregs, or both and what early Notch-regulated molecular events occur in alloantigen-specific T cells. To address these questions, we engineered T cell grafts to achieve selective Notch blockade in Tconv versus Tregs and evaluated their capacity to trigger GVHD in mice. Notch blockade in Tconv was essential for GVHD protection as GVHD severity was similar in the recipients of wild-type Tconv combined with Notch-deprived versus wild-type Tregs. To identify the impact of Notch signaling on the earliest steps of T cell activation in vivo, we established a new acute GVHD model mediated by clonal alloantigen-specific 4C CD4"

140,31189110,"Tripartite motif-containing protein 5α (TRIM5α) is a cellular antiviral restriction factor that prevents early events in retrovirus replication. The activity of TRIM5α is thought to be limited to retroviruses as a result of highly specific interactions with capsid lattices. In contrast to this current understanding, we show that both human and rhesus macaque TRIM5α suppress replication of specific flaviviruses. Multiple viruses in the tick-borne encephalitis complex are sensitive to TRIM5α-dependent restriction, but mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including yellow fever, dengue, and Zika viruses, are resistant. TRIM5α suppresses replication by binding to the viral protease NS2B/3 to promote its K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Importantly, TRIM5α contributes to the antiviral function of IFN-I against sensitive flaviviruses in human cells. Thus, TRIM5α possesses remarkable plasticity in the recognition of diverse virus families, with the potential to influence human susceptibility to emerging flaviviruses of global concern."

143,31206025,"The instructive capabilities of extracellular matrix-inspired materials for osteoprogenitor differentiation have sparked interest in understanding modulation of other cell types within the bone regenerative microenvironment. We previously demonstrated that nanoparticulate mineralized collagen glycosaminoglycan (MC-GAG) scaffolds efficiently induced osteoprogenitor differentiation and bone healing. In this work, we combined adenovirus-mediated delivery of osteoprotegerin (AdOPG), an endogenous anti-osteoclastogenic decoy receptor, in primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) with MC-GAG to understand the role of osteoclast inactivation in augmentation of bone regeneration. Simultaneous differentiation of osteoprogenitors on MC-GAG and osteoclast progenitors resulted in bidirectional positive regulation. AdOPG expression did not affect osteogenic differentiation alone. In the presence of both cell types, AdOPG-transduced hMSCs on MC-GAG diminished osteoclast-mediated resorption in direct contact; however, osteoclast-mediated augmentation of osteogenic differentiation was unaffected. Thus, the combination of OPG with MC-GAG may represent a method for uncoupling osteogenic and osteoclastogenic differentiation to augment bone regeneration."

The quality assessment of studies was performed according to Jadad scale. All studies showed that ginger had a positive effect on nausea in pregnant women. Unlike others studies, one study reported that ginger was not beneficial to the treatment of vomiting. Herbal medicines such as matricaria chamomilla, elettaria cardamomum, pomegranate and spearmint syrup, lemon provide safe and effective medical alternatives for treating pregnant women with mild to moderate NVD. The results suggested that ginger were more effective than vitamin B, but at the dose of 35-500 mg ginger, vitamin B6 and ginger had identical effect. However, over a longer treatment period (60 days), vitamin B6 was proved to be more effective than ginger. The same effect was observed in the comparison of quince and vitamin B6 as well as ginger and doxylamine plus pyridoxine. Mentha did not generated a positive effect on nausea and vomiting. However, this finding should be considered in the light of the above limitations.IMPACT STATEMENT"

147,31267560,"Genome duplication is essential for cell proliferation, and DNA synthesis is generally initiated by dedicated replication proteins at specific loci termed origins. In bacteria, the master initiator DnaA binds the chromosome origin (oriC) and unwinds the DNA duplex to permit helicase loading. However, despite decades of research it remained unclear how the information encoded within oriC guides DnaA-dependent strand separation. To address this fundamental question, we took a systematic genetic approach in vivo and identified the core set of essential sequence elements within the Bacillus subtilis chromosome origin unwinding region. Using this information, we then show in vitro that the minimal replication origin sequence elements are necessary and sufficient to promote the mechanical functions of DNA duplex unwinding by DnaA. Because the basal DNA unwinding system characterized here appears to be conserved throughout the bacterial domain, this discovery provides a framework for understanding oriC architecture, activity, regulation and diversity."

158,31373033,"Steroid hormones are key gene regulators in breast cancer cells. While estrogens stimulate cell proliferation, progestins activate a single cell cycle followed by proliferation arrest. Here, we use biochemical and genome-wide approaches to show that progestins achieve this effect via a functional crosstalk with C/EBPα. Using ChIP-seq, we identify around 1,000 sites where C/EBPα binding precedes and helps binding of progesterone receptor (PR) in response to hormone. These regions exhibit epigenetic marks of active enhancers, and C/EBPα maintains an open chromatin conformation that facilitates loading of ligand-activated PR. Prior to hormone exposure, C/EBPα favors promoter-enhancer contacts that assure hormonal regulation of key genes involved in cell proliferation by facilitating binding of RAD21, YY1, and the Mediator complex. Knockdown of C/EBPα disrupts enhancer-promoter contacts and decreases the presence of these architectural proteins, highlighting its key role in 3D chromatin looping. Thus, C/EBPα fulfills a previously unknown function as a potential growth modulator in hormone-dependent breast cancer."

Little is known, however, about a substantive aspect of this work: how hospital palliative clinicians anticipate and organize a patient's dying trajectory. In this paper I draw from a larger original ethnographic research study of palliative specialists in two Canadian hospitals. Abductive analysis resulted in framing their work as affective labour, both reflecting and re-creating a larger affective economy shaping the affective states of everyone involved in the provision and uptake of care. I articulate six analytically ideal outcomes of clinicians' affective labour that organize end of life, including: 1) proactive co-authorship of disease trajectory; 2) mutual acknowledgement of a dying trajectory; 3) naturalizing direction and outcome of care, 4) ensuring a minimum of social disruption, 5) identification as compassionate and efficient care providers, and 6) increased specialist knowledge and interventions. In so doing, clinicians' practices become understandable as labour to meet a diversity of - at times conflicting - individual, organizational, and societal mandates that necessarily include, but extend well beyond, the patient and her immediate social network. This is the first study to consider hospital palliative care as an affective economy, and presents a theoretically innovative and empirically grounded model to advance new ways of conceptualizing hospital palliative care. I conclude by considering how this model, and the unique insights it affords, can inform the future development of end of life care in hospital settings."

Both physiological and pathological retinal vascular growth and regression are controlled by photoreceptor energy demands. It is critical to understand the energy demands of photoreceptors and fuel sources supplying them to understand neurovascular diseases. Retinas are very rich in lipids, which are continuously recycled as lipid-rich photoreceptor outer segments are shed and reformed and dietary intake of lipids modulates retinal lipid composition. Lipids (as well as glucose) are fuel substrates for photoreceptor mitochondria. Dyslipidemia contributes to the development and progression of retinal dysfunction in many eye diseases. Here, we review photoreceptor energy demands with a focus on lipid metabolism in retinal neurovascular disorders."
170,31504997,"Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo explores tree space slowly, in part because it frequently returns to the same tree topology. An alternative strategy would be to explore tree space systematically, and never return to the same topology. In this article, we present an efficient parallelized method to map out the high likelihood set of phylogenetic tree topologies via systematic search, which we show to be a good approximation of the high posterior set of tree topologies on the data sets analyzed. Here, ""likelihood"" of a topology refers to the tree likelihood for the corresponding tree with optimized branch lengths. We call this method ""phylogenetic topographer"" (PT). The PT strategy is very simple: starting in a number of local topology maxima (obtained by hill-climbing from random starting points), explore out using local topology rearrangements, only continuing through topologies that are better than some likelihood threshold below the best observed topology. We show that the normalized topology likelihoods are a useful proxy for the Bayesian posterior probability of those topologies. By using a nonblocking hash table keyed on unique representations of tree topologies, we avoid visiting topologies more than once across all concurrent threads exploring tree space. We demonstrate that PT can be used directly to approximate a Bayesian consensus tree topology. When combined with an accurate means of evaluating per-topology marginal likelihoods, PT gives an alternative procedure for obtaining Bayesian posterior distributions on phylogenetic tree topologies."

In this investigation, we studied glucose homeostasis in twenty-four women with AN before (AN) and after weight restoration (WR) at a single institution, with both restricting and binge-purge subtypes (>70% binge-purge), compared to gender-, age- and BMI-matched healthy controls (HC). Participants underwent fasting plasma hormone analysis, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and body composition analysis. Glucose homeostasis was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and OGTT, and parameters were analyzed for association with body composition. We observed that a subset of the WR patients (21%) had metabolically unhealthy HOMA insulin resistance estimates (HOMA-IR), while this was not seen in the control group. Overall mean HOMA-IR between groups were not significantly different. Mean glucose reactivity was higher in the WR group than HC women (p = 0.008, Hedges' g = 0.811), and time-adjusted glucose reactivity in the WR group was inversely associated with visceral adiposity (r = -0.559, p = 0.006), but not with fat mass (r = -273, p = 0.208) or lean mass (r = -0.002, p = 0.994).

Glucometabolic profiling could offer novel insights to energy homeostasis acutely after weight restoration."

How this regional diversity develops from an initially uniform neuroepithelium has been the subject of decades of seminal research, and emerging technologies, including single-cell transcriptomics, provide a new perspective on area-specific molecular diversity. Here, we review the early developmental processes that underlie cortical arealization, including both cortex intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms as embodied by the protomap and protocortex hypotheses, respectively. We propose an integrated model of serial homology whereby intrinsic genetic programs and local factors establish early transcriptomic differences between excitatory neurons destined to give rise to broad ""proto-regions,"" and activity-dependent mechanisms lead to progressive refinement and formation of sharp boundaries between functional areas. Finally, we explore the potential of these basic developmental processes to inform our understanding of the emergence of functional neural networks and circuit abnormalities in neurodevelopmental disorders."

Clinical trials for safety, dosing and efficacy are lacking although age-dependent alterations of pharmacokinetics (PK), drug-drug-interactions (DDIs), as well as intravenous admixture incompatibilities (IAI) may impact drug efficacy and trigger side-effects in this vulnerable population. Consequently, implementation of a routinely used DDIs checking regimen may help guide in decision making and will assist clinicians to avoid serious and preventable events. Therefore, the goal of the present work is to identify and assess the risk of relevant DDIs of drugs commonly used in the NICU."
183,31625146,"Usher syndrome type 3 (USH3) is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder caused by mutations in the gene clarin-1 (CLRN1), leading to combined progressive hearing loss and retinal degeneration. The cellular distribution of CLRN1 in the retina remains uncertain, either because its expression levels are low or because its epitopes are masked. Indeed, in the adult mouse retina, Clrn1 mRNA is developmentally downregulated, detectable only by RT-PCR. In this study we used the highly sensitive RNAscope in situ hybridization assay and single-cell RNA-sequencing techniques to investigate the distribution of Clrn1 and CLRN1 in mouse and human retina, respectively. We found that Clrn1 transcripts in mouse tissue are localized to the inner retina during postnatal development and in adult stages. The pattern of Clrn1 mRNA cellular expression is similar in both mouse and human adult retina, with CLRN1 transcripts being localized in Müller glia, and not photoreceptors. We generated a novel knock-in mouse with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged CLRN1 and showed that CLRN1 is expressed continuously at the protein level in the retina. Following enzymatic deglycosylation and immunoblotting analysis, we detected a single CLRN1-specific protein band in homogenates of mouse and human retina, consistent in size with the main CLRN1 isoform. Taken together, our results implicate Müller glia in USH3 pathology, placing this cell type to the center of future mechanistic and therapeutic studies to prevent vision loss in this disease. © 2019 The Authors.

The system is based on inertial sensors and a microcontroller mounted on a glove and a forearm pad. The developed system was tested through the comparison of two off-the-shelf screwdrivers, one long and one short. Twelve male subjects participated in a within-subject experimental design test and performed a horizontal and a vertical screwing task for each screwdriver. Results indicated that the use of a long screwdriver causes significantly higher ulnar deviation of the wrist in both set-ups, while the short screwdriver promotes higher wrist extension in both set-ups. Clarity of the obtained results indicates that the proposed system is adequate for ergonomics studies on hand-tool design evaluation, while it addresses common pitfalls of other motion-capture methods."

To overcome its limitations, this article proposes an improved safety checklist analysis approach using intelligent video surveillance to replace on-site inspection. Then, a case study on metro tunnel construction is adopted to illustrate the process. First, the checklist is prepared. Second, the inspection items are correlated with construction areas, and intelligent cameras are positioned to cover the major areas of the construction site to guarantee that all the items can be checked. Thus, problems with inspection items are automatically identified and recorded. Third, the inspection items are marked by a remote scoring mechanism for safety assessment. Finally, the efficiency of the improved approach is tested by a comparative analysis among three groups. The application results indicate the feasibility of the improved approach for evaluating the safety management performance at construction sites."

192,31673697,"Androgen deficiency (hypogonadism) affects males of all ages. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is effective in restoring serum testosterone and relieving symptoms. TRT, however, is reported to have possible adverse effects in part because administered testosterone is not produced in response to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Progress in stem cell biology offers potential alternatives for treating hypogonadism. Adult Leydig cells (ALCs) are generated by stem Leydig cells (SLCs) during puberty. SLCs persist in the adult testis. Considerable progress has been made in the identification, isolation, expansion and differentiation of SLCs in vitro. In addition to forming ALCs, SLCs are multipotent, with the ability to give rise to all 3 major cell lineages of typical mesenchymal stem cells, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. Several regulatory factors, including Desert hedgehog and platelet-derived growth factor, have been reported to play key roles in the proliferation and differentiation of SLCs into the Leydig lineage. In addition, stem cells from several nonsteroidogenic sources, including embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mature fibroblasts, and mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord have been transdifferentiated into Leydig-like cells under a variety of induction protocols. ALCs generated from SLCs in vitro, as well as Leydig-like cells, have been successfully transplanted into ALC-depleted animals, restoring serum testosterone levels under HPG control. However, important questions remain, including: How long will the transplanted cells continue to function? Which induction protocol is safest and most effective? For translational purposes, more work is needed with primate cells, especially human."

The improvement of individual safety behavior needs more convincing and effective evidence. This study constructed a comprehensive theoretical model and used meta-analysis to examine the relationships between perceived organizational support for safety, organizational commitment and employee safety behavior. Support was found for the study's hypothesis that both perceived organizational support for safety and organizational commitment have a positive association with employee safety behavior, with the latter demonstrating the stronger relationship. However, organizational commitment was not mediated by perceived organizational support for safety and employee safety behavior. Results show that the safety behavior of employees in general industries and developed regions is more vulnerable to perceived organizational support for safety and organizational commitment than that in high-risk industries and developing regions.

In addition, increasing forced residual capacity (FRC) has not been demonstrated using mouthpiece PEP. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. This is an update of a previously published review."

Both uniform and heterogeneous skin thickness distributions of the whole body were considered and significant differences were observed. 100% second-degree burns were reached for the uniform skin model after 4-s flash fire, and maintained during the cooling phase. Third-degree burns occurred for the heterogeneous skin model during fire exposure, and the proportion increased in the cooling phase. Results indicated that the model with uniform skin thickness probably overestimates skin burns in the early stage of fire exposure. The prediction at the latter stage of the model with heterogeneous skin thickness tended to be more serious. Ignoring blood perfusion and dynamic thermophysical parameters of the skin model was the limitation of this study. Nevertheless, this method provides the basis for further advancements in thermal protective ensembles, to enhance occupational safety of firefighters."

216,31810768,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a promising therapy for several immune-mediated conditions but manufacturing a homogeneous and consistent product, especially one that includes cryopreservation, has been challenging. Discarded pediatric thymuses are an excellent source of therapeutic Tregs with advantages including cell quantity, homogeneity and stability. Here we report systematic testing of activation reagents, cell culture media, restimulation timing and cryopreservation to develop a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compatible method to expand and cryopreserve Tregs. By comparing activation reagents, including soluble antibody tetramers, antibody-conjugated beads and artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) and different media, we found that the combination of Dynabeads Treg Xpander and ImmunoCult-XF medium preserved FOXP3 expression and suppressive function and resulted in expansion that was comparable with a single stimulation with aAPCs. Cryopreservation tests revealed a critical timing effect: only cells cryopreserved 1-3 days, but not >3 days, after restimulation maintained high viability and FOXP3 expression upon thawing. Restimulation timing was a less critical process parameter than the time between restimulation and cryopreservation. This systematic testing of key variables provides increased certainty regarding methods for in vitro expansion and cryopreservation of Tregs. The ability to cryopreserve expanded Tregs will have broad-ranging applications including enabling centralized manufacturing and long-term storage of cell products."

This systematic review and meta-analysis compared outcomes and complications between nicotine/smoking, alcohol, and/or substance use in 26,512 burn patients admitted to the hospital to 299,543 burn patients admitted without these characteristics. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were systematically and independently searched. PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines were strictly followed. Clinical characteristics, nicotine/smoking use, alcohol use, substance use, outcomes and complications were recorded. Seventeen of the 27 studies included in the study, were eligible for meta-analysis, with results from 39 of the possible 84 outcomes and complications. In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis found that compared to non-nicotine/smoking, non-alcohol, non-substance use burn patients, patients using nicotine/smoking, alcohol, and/or substances were associated with more burn related operations, higher rates of graft loss/failure, longer hospital LOS (length of stay), higher rates of intubation, longer ICU (intensive care unit) LOS, increased mortality, and increased wound/local skin infections. Patients using nicotine/smoking were associated with higher rates of intubation and wound/local skin infections. Patients consuming alcohol were associated with more days on a ventilator, had higher rates of intubation, higher rates of inhalation injury, longer ICU LOS, and increased mortality. Patients taking substances were associated with higher %TBSA (percent total body surface area) of burns, longer hospital LOS, higher rates of intubation, higher rates of inhalation injury, longer ICU LOS, and increased wound/local skin infections."

220,31819973,"To evaluate a potential relationship between BRAF V600E mutation and PD-L1 expression, we examined the expression of PD-L1 in pediatric high- and low-grade glioma cell lines as well as a cohort of pediatric low-grade glioma patient samples. Half of the tumors in our patient cohort were V600-wildtype and half were V600E mutant. All tumors expressed PD-L1. In most tumors, PD-L1 expression was low (<5%), but in some cases over 50% of cells were positive. Extent of PD-L1 expression and immune cell infiltration was independent of BRAF V600E mutational status. All cell lines evaluated, including a BRAF V600E mutant xenograft, expressed PD-L1. Transient transfection of cell lines with a plasmid expressing mutant BRAF V600E had minimal effect on PD-L1 expression. These findings suggest that the PD-1 pathway is active in subsets of pediatric low-grade glioma as a mechanism of immune evasion independent of BRAF V600E mutational status. Low-grade gliomas that are unresectable and refractory to traditional therapy are associated with significant morbidity and continue to pose a treatment challenge. PD-1 pathway inhibitors may offer an alternative treatment approach. Clinical trials will be critical in determining whether PD-L1 expression indicates likely therapeutic benefit with immune checkpoint inhibitors."

222,31831513,"An 18-year-old woman with a history of hollow visceral myopathy presented with a small-bowel obstruction. High-dose opioid analgesia was required subsequently during hospital admission. She suffered two episodes of documented fasting hypoglycaemia, despite adjustment of parenteral carbohydrate administration. Investigations for non-insulin-mediated hypoglycaemia revealed a low morning cortisol of 109 nmol/L and an inappropriately low Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level of 2.2 pmol/L. A diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency was confirmed on repeat cortisol and ACTH testing. The 250 µg short Synacthen test cortisol response was normal, suggestive of acute rather than chronic ACTH deficiency. This pattern was consistent after further opioid exposure. Adrenal recovery occurred shortly after opioid cessation. Opioid-induced hypoadrenalism is likely an under-recognised clinical entity with potentially serious adverse patient outcomes. There are reported cases involving commonly prescribed opioids including fentanyl and tramadol. However, we believe this is the first reported clinical case of acute transient opioid-induced secondary hypoadrenalism associated with fasting hypoglycaemia."

We present a case of accelerated extrapulmonary silicosis in a lung transplant patient in whom the diagnosis of systemic silicosis was made incidental to non-respiratory complications that occurred during follow-up. The appearance of cytopenia and liver failure led to diagnostic tests that documented the presence of silicotic granulomas in those locations. Taking into account the intensity, time of exposure, onset and development of the disease, we found a highly atypical case of accelerated extrapulmonary silicosis in which inorganic particles (presumably silica) were documented inside granulomas and macrophages of the bone marrow. With these findings, we reflect on the lack of consideration of these entities within clinical practice, their probable under diagnosis and the need to study other pathophysiological mechanisms of acquisition and dissemination of silicosis."

233,31859093,"Burn injury pain is a significant public health problem. Burn injury treatment has improved tremendously in recent decades. However, an unintended consequence is that a larger number of patients now survive more severe injuries, and face intense pain that is very hard to treat. Although many efforts have been made to find alternative treatments, opioids remain the most effective medication available. Burn patients are frequently prescribed opioids in doses and durations that are significantly higher and longer than standard analgesic dosing guidelines. Despite this, many continue to experience unrelieved pain. They are also placed at a higher risk for developing dependence and opioid use disorder. Burn injury profoundly alters the functional state of the immune system. It also alters the expression levels of receptor, effector, and signaling molecules within the spinal cord's dorsal horn. These alterations could explain the reduced potency of opioids. However, recent studies demonstrate that different opioids signal preferentially via differential signaling pathways. This ligand-specific signaling by different opioids implies that burn injury may reduce the antinociceptive potency of opioids to different degrees, in a drug-specific manner. Indeed, recent findings hint at drug-specific differences in the ability of opioids to manage burn pain early after injury, as well as differences in their ability to prevent or treat the development of chronic and neuropathic pain. Here we review the current state of opioid treatment, as well as new findings that could potentially lead to opioid-based pain management strategies that may be significantly more effective than the current solutions."

Dynamic characteristics of mental workload were then analyzed employing subjective questionnaires, performance data and electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics. The analysis of non-linear dynamic characteristics of EEG signals showed that the fractal box dimension features of EEG signals are quite sensitive to the level of mental workload, exercising a significant impact on the four brain areas. The sample entropy is also quite sensitive to the level of mental workload, exercising a significant impact on the frontal, central and occipital areas. Based on this study, operational tasks can be dynamically assigned according to the state of personnel load and the safety and efficiency of the operation of the human-machine system can be ensured."

238,31875881,"A great deal of neuroimaging research focuses on voxel-wise analysis or segmentation of damaged tissue, yet many diseases are characterized by diffuse or non-regional neuropathology. In simple cases, these processes can be quantified using summary statistics of voxel intensities. However, the manifestation of a disease process in imaging data is often unknown, or appears as a complex and nonlinear relationship between the voxel intensities on various modalities. When the relevant pattern is unknown, summary statistics are often unable to capture differences between disease groups, and their use may encourage post hoc searches for the optimal summary measure. In this study, we introduce the multi-modal density testing (MMDT) framework for the naive discovery of group differences in voxel intensity profiles. MMDT operationalizes multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data as multivariate subject-level densities of voxel intensities and utilizes kernel density estimation to develop a local two-sample test for individual points within the density space. Through simulations, we show that this method controls type I error and recovers relevant differences when applied to a specified point. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to maintain power while controlling the family-wise error rate and false discovery rate when applying the test over a grid of points within the density space. Finally, we apply this method to a study of subjects with either multiple sclerosis (MS) or conditions that tend to mimic MS on MRI, and find significant differences between the two groups in their voxel intensity profiles within the thalamus."
239,31883840,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) subdue immune responses. Central to Treg activation are changes in lipid metabolism that support their survival and function. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are a family of lipid chaperones required to facilitate uptake and intracellular lipid trafficking. One family member, FABP5, is expressed in T cells, but its function remains unclear. We show that in Tregs, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of FABP5 function causes mitochondrial changes underscored by decreased OXPHOS, impaired lipid metabolism, and loss of cristae structure. FABP5 inhibition in Tregs triggers mtDNA release and consequent cGAS-STING-dependent type I IFN signaling, which induces heightened production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 and promotes Treg suppressive activity. We find evidence of this pathway, along with correlative mitochondrial changes in tumor infiltrating Tregs, which may underlie enhanced immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Together, our data reveal that FABP5 is a gatekeeper of mitochondrial integrity that modulates Treg function."

243,31898004,"Hybrid PET/MR imaging has significant potential in cardiology due to its combination of molecular PET imaging and cardiac MR. Multi-tissue-class MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC) is necessary for accurate PET quantification. Moreover, for thoracic PET imaging, respiration is known to lead to misalignments of MRAC and PET data that result in PET artifacts. These factors can be addressed by using multi-echo MR for tissue segmentation and motion-robust or motion-gated acquisitions. However, the combination of these strategies is not routinely available and can be prone to errors. In this study, we examine the qualitative and quantitative impacts of multi-class MRAC compared to a more widely available simple two-class MRAC for cardiac PET/MR."

248,31961647,"Biologically inspired structural color hydrogels with magnetic- and photothermal-controlled self-healable abilities were fabricated by integrating magnetic-responsive photonic crystals into gelatin hydrogels. The self-healable ability of the hydrogel systems was derived from the magnetic response and light-absorbing abilities of the magnetic nanoparticles. When the hydrogels deteriorate or get damaged, magnetic nanoparticles could absorb heat under near-infrared irradiation and external magnetic fields, which stimulates phase transformation in the hydrogels to fill or heal the hydrogels. In addition, the hydrogel systems were demonstrated with high biocompatibility and plasticity. These features of magnetic self-healable structural color hydrogels make them have broad application prospects in the fields of biological engineering and cell engineering."

250,31949051,"Negative checkpoint regulators (NCRs) temper the T cell immune response to self-antigens and limit the development of autoimmunity. Unlike all other NCRs that are expressed on activated T lymphocytes, V-type immunoglobulin domain-containing suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) is expressed on naïve T cells. We report an unexpected heterogeneity within the naïve T cell compartment in mice, where loss of VISTA disrupted the major quiescent naïve T cell subset and enhanced self-reactivity. Agonistic VISTA engagement increased T cell tolerance by promoting antigen-induced peripheral T cell deletion. Although a critical player in naïve T cell homeostasis, the ability of VISTA to restrain naïve T cell responses was lost under inflammatory conditions. VISTA is therefore a distinctive NCR of naïve T cells that is critical for steady-state maintenance of quiescence and peripheral tolerance."

A case study of participants' experiences of the workshop series identified three major themes: (1) the reciprocal and collaborative nature of participants' relationships; (2) the interplay between self-reflection and receiving feedback from others; and (3) the clinical and pedagogical implications of the CBPNM model. Principles and proposed outcomes of the CBPNM model are presented."
254,31995749,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) express high levels of cell surface lymphotoxin alpha beta (LTα1β2) to activate the LT beta receptor (LTβR) on the lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), modulating LEC adhesion molecules, intercellular junctions, and chemokines. We demonstrate a role for Tregs through this pathway to condition the permissiveness of lymphatic endothelia for transendothelial migration (TEM), thus gating leukocyte traffic. Human Tregs share the same property with murine Tregs. Activation of TLR2 on Tregs during inflammation specifically augments LTα1β2-LTβR signaling, which further enhances the permissiveness of LECs to facilitate TEM. The conditioning of endothelia may promote the resolution of inflammation by directing leukocytes out of tissues to lymphatic vessels and draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Thus, Tregs interact with lymphatic endothelia under homeostasis and inflammation and dictate endothelial permissiveness and gating mechanisms for subsequent leukocyte migration through endothelial barriers."

260,32039533,"The Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi has 7-11 periplasmic flagella (PF) that arise from the cell poles and extend toward the midcell as a flat-ribbon, which is distinct from other bacteria. FlhF, a signal recognition particle (SRP)-like GTPase, has been found to regulate the flagellar number and polarity; however, its role in B. burgdorferi remains unknown. B. burgdorferi has an FlhF homolog (BB0270). Structural and biochemical analyses show that BB0270 has a similar structure and enzymatic activity as its counterparts from other bacteria. Genetics and cryo-electron tomography studies reveal that deletion of BB0270 leads to mutant cells that have less PF (4 ± 2 PF per cell tip) and fail to form a flat-ribbon, indicative of a role of BB0270 in the control of PF number and configuration. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that BB0270 localizes at the cell poles and controls the number and position of PF via regulating the flagellar protein stability and the polar localization of the MS-ring protein FliF. Our study not only provides the detailed characterizations of BB0270 and its profound impacts on flagellar assembly, morphology and motility in B. burgdorferi, but also unveils mechanistic insights into how spirochetes control their unique flagellar patterns."

269,32080251,"During implantation, cytotrophoblasts undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as they differentiate into invasive extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs). The primate-specific microRNA cluster on chromosome 19 (C19MC) is exclusively expressed in the placenta, embryonic stem cells and certain cancers however, its role in EMT gene regulation is unknown. In situ hybridization for miR-517a/c, a C19MC cistron microRNA, in first trimester human placentas displayed strong expression in villous trophoblasts and a gradual decrease from proximal to distal cell columns as cytotrophoblasts differentiate into invasive EVTs. To investigate the role of C19MC in the regulation of EMT genes, we employed the CRISPR/dCas9 Synergistic Activation Mediator (SAM) system, which induced robust transcriptional activation of the entire C19MC cistron and resulted in suppression of EMT associated genes. Exposure of human iPSCs to hypoxia or differentiation of iPSCs into either cytotrophoblast-stem-like cells or EVT-like cells under hypoxia reduced C19MC expression and increased EMT genes. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of the C19MC cistron induced the expression of OCT4 and FGF4 and accelerated cellular reprogramming. This study establishes the CRISPR/dCas9 SAM as a powerful tool that enables activation of the entire C19MC cistron and uncovers its novel role in suppressing EMT genes critical for maintaining the epithelial cytotrophoblasts stem cell phenotype."
270,32094231,"Photoreceptors have high energy demands and a high density of mitochondria that produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) of fuel substrates. Although glucose is the major fuel for CNS brain neurons, in photoreceptors (also CNS), most glucose is not metabolized through OXPHOS but is instead metabolized into lactate by aerobic glycolysis. The major fuel sources for photoreceptor mitochondria remained unclear for almost six decades. Similar to other tissues (like heart and skeletal muscle) with high metabolic rates, photoreceptors were recently found to metabolize fatty acids (palmitate) through OXPHOS. Disruption of lipid entry into photoreceptors leads to extracellular lipid accumulation, suppressed glucose transporter expression, and a duel lipid/glucose fuel shortage. Modulation of lipid metabolism helps restore photoreceptor function. However, further elucidation of the types of lipids used as retinal energy sources, the metabolic interaction with other fuel pathways, as well as the cross-talk among retinal cells to provide energy to photoreceptors is not fully understood. In this review, we will focus on the current understanding of photoreceptor energy demand and sources, and potential future investigations of photoreceptor metabolism."

Individuals can encounter significant and acute variations in exposure over small spatiotemporal scales. Exposure is strongly tied to both the environmental and activity contexts that individuals experience. Here we present the development of an agent-based model to simulate human exposure at high spatiotemporal resolutions. The model is based on simulated activity and location trajectories on a per-person basis for large geographical areas. We demonstrate that the model can successfully estimate trajectories and that activity patterns have been validated against traffic patterns and that can be integrated with exposure-agent geographical distributions to estimate total human exposure.

Liquid biopsy analysis of circulating cell-free DNA fragments in the patients' blood can monitor clonality and evolving mutations as a surrogate for tumour biopsy. Next generation sequencing platforms and digital droplet PCR can be used to profile circulating tumour DNA from liquid biopsies; however, they are expensive and time consuming for clinical use. Here, we report a novel strategy with proof-of-concept data that supports the usage of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect PIK3CA c.3140 A > G (H1047R), a prevalent BC missense mutation that is attributed to BC tumour growth. Allele-specific primers were designed and optimized to detect the p.H1047R variant following the USS-sbLAMP method. The assay was developed with synthetic DNA templates and validated with DNA from two breast cancer cell-lines and two patient tumour tissue samples through a qPCR instrument and finally piloted on an ISFET enabled microchip. This work sets a foundation for BC mutational profiling on a Lab-on-Chip device, to help the early detection of patient relapse and to monitor efficacy of systemic therapies for personalised cancer patient management."

286,32204948,"Within palliative care, clear and open communication about death is encouraged. Euphemisms are discouraged as threats to promoting clear understanding of the prognosis; to opening communication about what a good death means to individual patients and families; and to fostering collaborative planning aimed at achieving this 'good death'. Principles of patient-centred and culturally competent care, however, which reflect trends of individualisation, plurality and multiculturalism that are characteristic of late modernity, encourage respect for and support of patients' and families' preferences. These may include wishes to avoid open communication, preferences for euphemisms, and definitions of a 'good death' that vary from the practitioner's, and within families. The aim of this study was to examine how physicians navigate these competing priorities. Analysis is based on interviews with 23 doctors, ranging in experience from medical students through to senior palliative care specialists, and eight recorded observations of palliative care multidisciplinary team meetings with 52 clinicians collected in 2017 at two hospitals in one Australian metropolitan area. Findings show that synonyms familiar to clinicians are often used to communicate prognoses in multidisciplinary meetings. In communication with patients and families, doctors rely on emotional and cultural cues to decipher the preferred terminology and response. Drawing on a late modern re-imagination of emotion management, we conceptualise the work performed in this context as emotionally reflexive labour. These findings suggest that blanket protocols for direct communication overlook the complexity of end-of-life communication in an era where a 'good death' is understood to be culturally relative."
287,32202508,"Ovarian cancer is one of the most malignant tumors of the female reproductive system, with high invasiveness. The disease is a severe threat to women's health. The ITGA2 gene, which codes for integrin subunit α2, is involved in the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells. Although previous studies have shown that ITGA2 increases in ovarian cancer, the specific molecular mechanism of how ITGA2 promotes ovarian cancer proliferation and metastasis is still unclear. In this study, we confirmed that ITGA2 was elevated in ovarian cancer, which led to poor prognosis and survival. Overexpressed ITGA2 promoted the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. We also found that ITGA2 regulated the phosphorylation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by mediating AKT phosphorylation, which provided a reasonable explanation for ITGA2's role in ovarian cancer's resistance to albumin paclitaxel. In summary, ITGA2 could be used as a new therapeutic target and prognostic indicator in ovarian cancer."

290,32201880,"Substantial advances have been made recently in the pathobiology of pituitary tumors. Similar to many other endocrine tumors, over the last few years we have recognized the role of germline and somatic mutations in a number of syndromic or nonsyndromic conditions with pituitary tumor predisposition. These include the identification of novel germline variants in patients with familial or simplex pituitary tumors and establishment of novel somatic variants identified through next generation sequencing. Advanced techniques have allowed the exploration of epigenetic mechanisms mediated through DNA methylation, histone modifications and noncoding RNAs, such as microRNA, long noncoding RNAs and circular RNAs. These mechanisms can influence tumor formation, growth, and invasion. While genetic and epigenetic mechanisms often disrupt similar pathways, such as cell cycle regulation, in pituitary tumors there is little overlap between genes altered by germline, somatic, and epigenetic mechanisms. The interplay between these complex mechanisms driving tumorigenesis are best studied in the emerging multiomics studies. Here, we summarize insights from the recent developments in the regulation of pituitary tumorigenesis."

293,32214098,"Biofilm formation by Vibrio cholerae facilitates environmental persistence, and hyperinfectivity within the host. Biofilm formation is regulated by 3',5'-cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) and requires production of the type IV mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) pilus. Here, we show that the MSHA pilus is a dynamic extendable and retractable system, and its activity is directly controlled by c-di-GMP. The interaction between c-di-GMP and the ATPase MshE promotes pilus extension, whereas low levels of c-di-GMP correlate with enhanced retraction. Loss of retraction facilitated by the ATPase PilT increases near-surface roaming motility, and impairs initial surface attachment. However, prolonged retraction upon surface attachment results in reduced MSHA-mediated surface anchoring and increased levels of detachment. Our results indicate that c-di-GMP directly controls MshE activity, thus regulating MSHA pilus extension and retraction dynamics, and modulating V. cholerae surface attachment and colonization."

296,32225141,"The Dot/Icm secretion system of Legionella pneumophila is a complex type IV secretion system (T4SS) nanomachine that localizes at the bacterial pole and mediates the delivery of protein and DNA substrates to target cells, a process generally requiring direct cell-to-cell contact. We have recently solved the structure of the Dot/Icm apparatus by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and showed that it forms a cell envelope-spanning channel that connects to a cytoplasmic complex. Applying two complementary approaches that preserve the native structure of the specimen, fluorescent microscopy in living cells and cryo-ET, allows in situ visualization of proteins and assimilation of the stoichiometry and timing of production of each machine component relative to other Dot/Icm subunits. To investigate the requirements for polar positioning and to characterize dynamic features associated with T4SS machine biogenesis, we have fused a gene encoding superfolder green fluorescent protein to Dot/Icm ATPase genes at their native positions on the chromosome. The following method integrates quantitative fluorescence microscopy of living cells and cryo-ET to quantify polar localization, dynamics, and structure of these proteins in intact bacterial cells. Applying these approaches for studying the Legionella pneumophila T4SS is useful for characterizing the function of the Dot/Icm system and can be adapted to study a wide variety of bacterial pathogens that utilize the T4SS or other types of bacterial secretion complexes."

Shriners Hospitals for Children - Boston a pediatric burn center in New England and cares for both domestic and international patients. We utilized our experience over the past 13 years to review surgical management and evaluate historical trends for this unique patient group. A retrospective chart review was conducted on 68 patients aged 0-18 years admitted to our pediatric center with an electrical burn from January 2005 to December 2018. We collected and analyzed data pertaining to patient demographics, burn characteristics, clinical course, and surgical interventions. Our cohort included 31 patients from the US (46%) and 37 transferred from a variety of international countries (54%). The majority of US patients were admitted with low voltage burns (81%), whereas the majority of international patients were admitted with high voltage burns (95%). Acute and reconstructive surgical interventions were performed mainly for high voltage burns (94% and 89%). Based on our experience, epidemiology and surgical intervention varied based on voltage of the burn injury and residence of the patient. We have seen a reduction in US pediatric high voltage injuries over the past two decades, likely due to enhancement of electrical safety. It may be possible to use a similar strategy to reduce the frequency of severe high voltage electrical burn injuries in developing countries."
303,32245662,"The study addresses the benefit of tuning single harmonics with vocal tract resonances to increase vocal loudness. The loudness of theoretically constructed vocal sounds with variable levels of sound energy in the first, second, and third harmonics is computed on the basis of ISO standard 226:2003. In comparison to increased loudness with changes in overall spectral slope, it is shown that single harmonic tuning requires a greater range of SPL to produce a similar range of loudness. For example, a 10-40 dB increase in the level of a single harmonic produces less than two doublings of loudness, whereas a spectral slope change from -12 dB/octave to -3 dB/octave can produce a similar doubling of loudness with only a 5 dB SPL increase."

307,32255769,"Immunosuppressive donor Tregs can prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or solid-organ allograft rejection. We previously demonstrated that inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) augments FOXP3 expression, stabilizing induced Tregs (iTregs). Here we report that human pSTAT3-inhibited iTregs prevent human skin graft rejection and xenogeneic GVHD yet spare donor antileukemia immunity. pSTAT3-inhibited iTregs express increased levels of skin-homing cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen, immunosuppressive GARP and PD-1, and IL-9 that supports tolerizing mast cells. Further, pSTAT3-inhibited iTregs significantly reduced alloreactive conventional T cells, Th1, and Th17 cells implicated in GVHD and tissue rejection and impaired infiltration by pathogenic Th2 cells. Mechanistically, pSTAT3 inhibition of iTregs provoked a shift in metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to glycolysis and reduced electron transport chain activity. Strikingly, cotreatment with coenzyme Q10 restored OxPhos in pSTAT3-inhibited iTregs and augmented their suppressive potency. These findings support the rationale for clinically testing the safety and efficacy of metabolically tuned, human pSTAT3-inhibited iTregs to control alloreactive T cells."

312,32273211,"The greatest rate of change in the glottal flow rate during phonation is a rapid decrease that occurs during the latter part of the glottal closing. Previous works showed that intraglottal flow separation vortices form in a divergent glottis, produce negative gauge pressures (below atmospheric) during closing. It is hypothesized here that flow separation vortices contribute to the rapid closing mechanism of the true vocal folds during phonation. Four idealized static models (M5) of the human larynx were investigated using large eddy simulation: 2 models featured parallel folds that did not enable flow separation in the glottis and 2 models involved a divergent glottis. The influence of the ventricular gap (narrow/wide) is evaluated. An unsteady pressure inlet representing a voicing cycle was applied to the sub-glottal region to mimic the time-varying glottal flow. Intraglottal vortex structures formed downstream of the separation point in a divergent glottis. Their existence caused a higher closing force that was applied onto the vocal folds. A narrow ventricular gap strengthens this effect. Strength of the intraglottal vortices increased with the maximum flow declination rate. Therefore, a more divergent shape of the glottis during glottal closing will be one of the main contributors to the voice quality."

Prior work has shown that mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibition can increase the stability of thymic Tregs. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic signatures of ex vivo-expanded Tregs after adoptive transfer in the setting of clinically relevant immunosuppression using a nonhuman primate (NHP) model as a prelude to future transplant studies. Here, we found that adding interleukin-2 (IL-2) to rapamycin in vivo supported a logarithmic increase in the half-life of adoptively transferred carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-labeled, autologous NHP Tregs, effectively doubling the number of cells in the peripheral blood Treg compartment compared with Treg infusion when rapamycin was given alone. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we found that transferred ex vivo-expanded Tregs initially exhibit a gene expression signature consistent with an activated state. Moreover, those cells with the highest levels of activation also expressed genes associated with p53-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, transferred Tregs interrogated at day +20 posttransfer demonstrated a gene signature more similar to published profiles of resting Tregs. Together, these preclinical data further support combining IL-2 and rapamycin in vivo as adjunctive therapy for ex vivo-expanded adoptively transferred Tregs and suggest that the activation status of ex vivo-expanded Tregs is critical to their persistence."
320,32312532,"Advance care planning is premised on concepts of individual autonomy and self-determination. The standardisation of this individualist approach to decision-making erases the diverse cultural sensibilities and vocabularies that shape trajectories of care. In attempting to redress this exclusion, this paper foregrounds previously overlooked vernaculars and practices for understanding how care for the aged and those approaching the end of life is understood and enacted in Australia's culturally diverse society. Drawing on ethnographic interviews and participant-observation with ageing Chinese migrants and their families in Adelaide, South Australia, it examines the multiple enactments of 'face' in end-of-life care. In so doing, the paper extends Goffman's theorisation of 'face', opening up the 'front' of the bounded individual to reveal how persons are mutually implicated in relational contexts. Attending to cultural contours of face and their intersections with filial piety, this paper unsettles the imperative of self-determination in advance care planning and reveals how intergenerational shifts from older to younger generations can reorient care at the end of life."

323,32313224,"Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was the first successful therapy for patients with haematological malignancies, predominantly owing to graft-versus-tumour (GvT) effects. Dramatic methodological changes, designed to expand eligibility for allo-HSCT to older patients and/or those with comorbidities, have led to the use of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, in parallel with more aggressive immunosuppression to better control graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Consequently, disease relapse has become the major cause of death following allo-HSCT. Hence, the prevention and treatment of relapse has come to the forefront and remains an unmet medical need. Despite >60 years of preclinical and clinical studies, the immunological requirements necessary to achieve GvT effects without promoting GvHD have not been fully established. Herein, we review learnings from preclinical modelling and clinical studies relating to the GvT effect, focusing on mechanisms of relapse and on immunomodulatory strategies that are being developed to overcome disease recurrence after both allo-HSCT and autologous HSCT. Emphasis is placed on discussing current knowledge and approaches predicated on the use of cell therapies, cytokines to augment immune responses and dual-purpose antibody therapies or other pharmacological agents that can control GvHD whilst simultaneously targeting cancer cells."

336,32362579,"Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis is a highly recurrent and residual disease. The use of indigo-carmine chromoendoscopy increases the early detection of nonvisible disease and reduces the possibility of leaving residual lesions. The best chances of papillomatosis being eradicated depend upon a surgical shallow epitheliolysis approach applied to patients who have never been surgically damaged before. We developed a novel surgical technique based upon the use of a time controlled High Radiofrequency (HRF) energy output. We applied a three-step bloodless HRF-surgical technique, that is, epitheliolysis, angiolysis and peeling without the aid of adjunct therapies. It acts according to differences in the water density of the tissues. We use it to remove the epithelial viral reservoir thus preserving subepithelial layers. For this purpose, we designed and manufactured a custom-made HRF electrodes set for office and O.R. use. From 2005 to 2018, 39 patients (100%) with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis participated in the present prospective work. Twenty-five (64,10%) achieved complete postsurgical remission, 6 (15,38%) were lost to follow up, and 8 (20,51%) present partial remissions. Thirty-six patients had laryngeal papillomatosis. Follow-up was possible in 30 of the 36 patients with laryngeal papillomatosis with a success remission rate of 83,33% (25 of 30). Eleven of those 36 (30,55%) entered this study without previous surgical treatment and 9 of 11 (81,81%) were cured. Indigo-carmine chromoendoscopy, a visualization solution for papillomatosis detection, together with a bloodless HRF-surgical technique proved to be effective tools to eradicate papillomatosis.

337,32374421,"Uterine leiomyomas, also referred to as myomas or fibroids, are benign tumours arising from the smooth muscle cells of the myometrium. They are the most common pelvic tumour in women. The estimated rate of leiomyosarcoma, found during surgery for presumed benign leiomyomas, is about 0.51 per 1000 procedures, or approximately 1 in 2000. Treatment options for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas include medical, surgical, and radiologically-guided interventions. Laparoscopic myomectomy is the gold standard surgical approach for women who want offspring, or otherwise wish to retain their uterus. A limitation of laparoscopy is the inability to remove large specimens from the abdominal cavity through the laparoscope. To overcome this challenge, the morcellation approach was developed, during which larger specimens are broken into smaller pieces in order to remove them from the abdominal cavity via the port site. However, intracorporeal power morcellation may lead to scattering of benign tissues, with the risk of spreading leiomyoma or endometriosis. In cases of unsuspected malignancy, power morcellation can cause unintentional dissemination of malignant cells, and lead to a poorer prognosis by upstaging the occult cancer. A strategy to optimise women's safety is to morcellate the specimens inside a bag. In-bag morcellation may avoid the dissemination of tissue fragments."

To date, most of the research on patient ownership has focused on residents' understanding of what it means to own patients. This exploratory study explored third- and fourth-year students', residents, and attending physicians' understanding of the phrase ""taking ownership of a patient."" Data included participant observations and interviews that expanded over a five month period. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using psychological ownership as an analytical lens and latent content analysis as a method. Third-year students primarily understood the phrase to mean communicating with patients and their immediate team. Fourth-year students indicated it was an expectation to contribute to the management of patient care. Residents and faculty thought patient ownership included an emotional investment in patients. The phrase taking ownership of patients is understood differently depending on where participants are in their development, even though it is assumed there is a shared understanding across team members. Given the variability in understanding, educators should have explicit discussions with learners about commonly used concepts to help them develop sophisticated understandings and monitor their own development."

Circadian rhythms arose from evolutionary needs to maximize daily organismal fitness by enabling organisms to mount anticipatory and adaptive responses to recurrent light-dark cycles and associated environmental changes. The clock is a conserved feature in nearly all forms of life, ranging from prokaryotes to virtually every cell of multicellular eukaryotes. The mammalian clock comprises transcription factors interlocked in negative feedback loops, which generate circadian expression of genes that coordinate rhythmic physiology. In this review, we highlight previous and recent studies that have advanced our understanding of the transcriptional architecture of the mammalian clock, with a specific focus on epigenetic mechanisms, transcriptomics, and 3-dimensional chromatin architecture. In addition, we discuss reciprocal ways in which the clock and metabolism regulate each other to generate metabolic rhythms. We also highlight implications of circadian biology in human health, ranging from genetic and environment disruptions of the clock to novel therapeutic opportunities for circadian medicine. Finally, we explore remaining fundamental questions and future challenges to advancing the field forward."
346,32393961,"Physical activity decreases the risk of a network of diseases, and exercise may be prescribed as medicine for lifestyle-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes, dementia, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. During the past couple of decades, it has been apparent that skeletal muscle works as an endocrine organ, which can produce and secrete hundreds of myokines that exert their effects in either autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manners. Recent advances show that skeletal muscle produces myokines in response to exercise, which allow for crosstalk between the muscle and other organs, including brain, adipose tissue, bone, liver, gut, pancreas, vascular bed, and skin, as well as communication within the muscle itself. Although only few myokines have been allocated to a specific function in humans, it has been identified that the biological roles of myokines include effects on, for example, cognition, lipid and glucose metabolism, browning of white fat, bone formation, endothelial cell function, hypertrophy, skin structure, and tumor growth. This suggests that myokines may be useful biomarkers for monitoring exercise prescription for people with, for example, cancer, diabetes, or neurodegenerative diseases."
347,32396624,"Insulin has been available for the treatment of diabetes for almost a century, and the variety of insulin choices today represents many years of discovery and innovation. Insulin has gone from poorly defined extracts of animal pancreata to pure and precisely controlled formulations that can be prescribed and administered with high accuracy and predictability of action. Modifications of the insulin formulation and of the insulin molecule itself have made it possible to approximate the natural endogenous insulin response. Insulin and insulin formulations had to be designed to produce either a constant low basal level of insulin or the spikes of insulin released in response to meals. We discuss how the biochemical properties of endogenous insulin were exploited to either shorten or extend the time-action profiles of injectable insulins by varying the pharmacokinetics (time for appearance of insulin in the blood after injection) and pharmacodynamics (time-dependent changes in blood sugar after injection). This has resulted in rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, and long-acting insulins, as well as mixtures and concentrated formulations. An understanding of how various insulins and formulations were designed to solve the challenges of insulin replacement will assist clinicians in meeting the needs of their individual patients."

We reviewed the health records for all patients hospitalized with Covid-19 between March 1, and April 5, 2020, at 13 academic and community hospitals in metropolitan New York. Patients younger than 18 years of age, with end stage kidney disease or with a kidney transplant were excluded. AKI was defined according to KDIGO criteria. Of 5,449 patients admitted with Covid-19, AKI developed in 1,993 (36.6%). The peak stages of AKI were stage 1 in 46.5%, stage 2 in 22.4% and stage 3 in 31.1%. Of these, 14.3% required renal replacement therapy (RRT). AKI was primarily seen in Covid-19 patients with respiratory failure, with 89.7% of patients on mechanical ventilation developing AKI compared to 21.7% of non-ventilated patients. 276/285 (96.8%) of patients requiring RRT were on ventilators. Of patients who required ventilation and developed AKI, 52.2% had the onset of AKI within 24 hours of intubation. Risk factors for AKI included older age, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, black race, hypertension and need for ventilation and vasopressor medications. Among patients with AKI, 694 died (35%), 519 (26%) were discharged and 780 (39%) were still hospitalized. AKI occurs frequently among patients with Covid-19 disease. It occurs early and in temporal association with respiratory failure and is associated with a poor prognosis."

353,32418408,"Babies born at the limit of viability have a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Despite great advances in science, the approach to these newborns remains challenging. Thus, this study reviewed the literature regarding the treatment of newborns at the limit of viability. There are several interventions that can be applied before and after birth to increase the baby's survival with the least sequelae possible, but different countries make different recommendations on the gestational age that each treatment should be given. There is more consensus on the extremities of viability, being that, at the lower extremity, comfort care is preferred and active care in newborns with higher gestational age. The higher the gestational age at birth, the higher the survival and survival without morbidity rates. At all gestational ages, it is important to take into account the suffering of these babies and to provide them the best quality of life possible. Sometimes palliative care is the best therapeutic approach. The parents of these babies should be included in the decision-making process, if they wish, always respecting their needs and wishes. Nevertheless, the process of having such an immature child can be very painful for parents, so it is also important to take into account their suffering and provide them with all the necessary support.

Distinct from pharmacologic immune suppression, we have developed what we believe is a novel, human CD83-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell for GVHD prevention. CD83 is expressed on allo-activated conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs) and proinflammatory dendritic cells (DCs), which are both implicated in GVHD pathogenesis. Human CD83 CAR T cells eradicate pathogenic CD83+ target cells, substantially increase the ratio of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to allo-activated Tconvs, and provide durable prevention of xenogeneic GVHD. CD83 CAR T cells are also capable of treating xenogeneic GVHD. We show that human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) expresses CD83 and that myeloid leukemia cell lines are readily killed by CD83 CAR T cells. Human CD83 CAR T cells are a promising cell-based approach to preventing 2 critical complications of allo-HCT - GVHD and relapse. Thus, the use of human CD83 CAR T cells for GVHD prevention and treatment, as well as for targeting CD83+ AML, warrants clinical investigation."
361,32437333,"Acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) remains a major impediment to successful allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). To solve this problem, a greater knowledge of factors that regulate the differentiation of donor T cells toward cytotoxic cells or Tregs is necessary. We report that the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) is critical for regulating this differentiation and that its manipulation can control aGvHD without impairing the graft-versus-tumor (GvT) effect. Donor T cell β2-AR expression and signaling is associated with decreased aGvHD when compared with recipients of β2-AR-/- donor T cells. We determined that β2-AR activation skewed CD4+ T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo toward Tregs rather than the T helper 1 (Th1) phenotype. Treatment of allo-HCT recipients with a selective β2-agonist (bambuterol) ameliorated aGvHD severity. This was associated with increased Tregs, decreased cytotoxic T cells, and increased donor BM-derived myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in allogeneic and humanized xenogeneic aGvHD models. β2-AR signaling resulted in increased Treg generation through glycogen synthase kinase-3 activation. Bambuterol preserved the GvT effect by inducing NKG2D+ effector cells and central memory T cells. These data reveal how β-AR signaling can be targeted to ameliorate GvHD severity while preserving GvT effect."
362,32438781,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease with increasing global incidence, which has a multifactorial pathogenesis and a variable expressivity. Clinical features of AD are different in adults compared to children, but it is well recognized the substantial impact of the disease on patients' quality of life at any age. Indeed, little is known about AD in adolescence, a period of life generally associated with high psychological burden and vulnerability to depression. Guidelines for the management of AD are available for both children and adults but specific guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AD in adolescents are lacking. Seven Italian scientific societies of dermatologists, allergists, and pediatric allergists joined in a specific meeting to provide practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of moderate-to-severe adolescent AD suitable for the Italian clinical practice. Through a modified Delphi procedure, consensus was reached by 59 Italian experts in the management of AD on 20 statements covering five areas of interest about adolescent AD, including disease complexity, burden and social impact, diagnosis and definition of severity, current treatments, and new biologic therapies. This paper reports recommendations for the diagnosis and management of AD specifically in adolescents, pointing out some peculiar clinical features and focusing on the choice of medications. Dupilumab, the first biologic approved for the treatment of adolescents with AD, represents a useful treatment option due to its efficacy and reassuring safety profile."

365,32440974,"A large body of experimental evidence in the empirical sciences shows that writing about life experiences can be beneficial for mental and physical health. While empirical data regarding the health benefits of writing interventions have been collected in numerous studies in psychology and biomedicine, this literature has remained almost entirely disconnected from scholarship in the humanities and cognitive neuropsychology. In this paper, I review the literature from psychological and biomedical writing interventions, connect these findings to views from philosophy, cognitive neuropsychology and narratology and argue that examining established regularities in how narratives are structured can shed further light on the psychological processes engaged during writing interventions. In particular, I argue that the narratological concept of conflict can be applied to resolve patterns of seemingly conflicting empirical findings in psychological studies. More generally, I propose that an interdisciplinary perspective can provide a broader theoretical basis for understanding the psychological processes underlying the health benefits of autobiographical writing and provide directions for future research in psychology and biomedicine."

369,32451129,"This study reviews free tissue transfer (FTT) surgery for both acute wound and reconstructive scar management of burn injuries at a UK burns unit over a 10-year period. Thirty eight patients underwent 46 FTTs, or free flaps, as part of their burn injury pathway. For the cohort of patients, there was one flap failure, which occurred for a secondary scar reconstruction. It is noted that FTT was successful for all seven acute or primary interventions. Anterolateral thigh flap was the most frequently performed (57%); followed by parascapular flaps (22%) of which 43% were pre-expanded. A method of pre-expansion for neck contractures and a novel technique of anchoring this flap to the pre-tracheal fascia are described here. This can provide the patient with good neck contouring by using the capsule to hitch the flap into a good position. It is clear that further work is required to study the prevention of hypertrophic scarring that can occur at the interface between flap and adjacent skin, where occurrence rate in this cohort was 17%. It is proposed that FTT now provides a viable solution both to the coverage of complex burn wounds and to the revision of scar contractures. Consensus over an FTT protocol for the primary management of open burn wounds is seen as the logical next step for this surgical intervention."

371,32455432,"Glucose and insulin metabolism in patients with diabetes are profoundly altered by advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Risk of hypoglycemia is increased by failure of kidney gluconeogenesis, impaired insulin clearance by the kidney, defective insulin degradation due to uremia, increased erythrocyte glucose uptake during hemodialysis, impaired counterregulatory hormone responses (cortisol, growth hormone), nutritional deprivation, and variability of exposure to oral antihyperglycemic agents and exogenous insulin. Patients with end-stage kidney disease frequently experience wide glycemic excursions, with common occurrences of both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Assessment of glycemia by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is hampered by a variety of CKD-associated conditions that can bias the measure either to the low or high range. Alternative glycemic biomarkers, such as glycated albumin or fructosamine, are not fully validated. Therefore, HbA1c remains the preferred glycemic biomarker despite its limitations. Based on observational data for associations with mortality and risks of hypoglycemia with intensive glycemic control regimens in advanced CKD, an HbA1c range of 7% to 8% appears to be the most favorable. Emerging data on the use of continuous glucose monitoring in this population suggest promise for more precise monitoring and treatment adjustments to permit fine-tuning of glycemic management in patients with diabetes and advanced CKD."

374,32475797,"Burn injuries are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite advances in therapeutic strategies for the management of patients with severe burns, the sequelae are pathophysiologically profound, up to the systemic and metabolic levels. Management of patients with a severe burn injury is a long-term, complex process, with treatment dependent on the degree and location of the burn and total body surface area (TBSA) affected. In adverse conditions with limited resources, efficient triage, stabilisation, and rapid transfer to a specialised intensive care burn centre is necessary to provide optimal outcomes. This initial lag time and the form of primary treatment initiated, from injury to specialist care, is crucial for the burn patient. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of a novel visco-elastic burn dressing with a proprietary bio-stimulatory marine mineral complex (MXC) as a primary care treatment to initiate a healthy healing process prior to specialist care."
375,32482377,"Burn wounds contain high levels of protease activity due to the need to remodel the damaged extracellular matrix proteins. While necessary, excessive protease activity can lead to improper wound healing and is associated with increased contraction and fibrosis. No studies to date have investigated the expression changes of all the collagenases and elastases in burn wounds. The present study compares gene expression changes and changes in collagenase and elastase activity between burn wound eschar and normal skin in a pediatric population. Deidentified pediatric tissues were used for these experiments. Burn wound tissue was excised as part of normal standard care within a week from injury; normal skin was removed during elective plastic surgery procedures. RNA-sequencing was performed and significant results were confirmed with qRT-PCR. Activity assays showed a significant increase in both collagenase and elastase activity in the burn wound tissue compared to the normal skin. Western blotting and substrate zymography of tissue homogenates evaluated the results at the protein levels. Four elastases and three collagenases were determined to be significantly upregulated in the wound tissues by both RNA-sequencing and qRT-PCR. Cathepsin V was the only protease that was significantly downregulated. All but one metalloproteinase studied was significantly upregulated. None of the serine proteases were significantly altered in the wound tissues. In conclusion, matrix metalloproteinases appear to be the most highly elevated proteases after a pediatric burn wound injury, at least within the first 3-7 days. The data warrant further investigation into the effects of MMPs on burn wound healing."

377,32499048,"Hypertrophic scars are usually evaluated based on scar assessment scales such as Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) which are difficult in recording small changes in the scar conditions over time. This study adopts a simple method to quantify the size of hypertrophic scars on hands by using a camera and tripod set-up for image capturing and a free software, ImageJ, for analysis. The ability to record the changes in scars condition and healing progress of this method were investigated. Four hypertrophic scar samples on the hands were captured at 8 time-points during 24-week of pressure therapy. Three operators were trained for 2h to use the software and then carried out image analysis on 32 scar images to obtain the surface areas of the hand and the scars and repeat the entire measurement for 3 times. The results show that the measured scar surface areas have good intra-operator reliability with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.943 (0.922, 0.96) and moderate inter-operator reliability with an ICC of 0.554 (0.063, 0.795). No significant within-subject effect of the repeat of measurements (p>0.05) and between-subject effect of the three operators (p>0.05) were found on the scar area measurements and the proportion of the scars on hands but significant differences were found between different time-points of the image capturing (p<0.05). The image analysis method is more sensitive to the change of scars conditions over time than the VSS record. This is an economical and relatively easy method to quantify the changes in the hypertrophic scars which could be useful for monitoring the progress of therapy and encourage treatment compliance."

Acute meningitis is an emergent disease that develops over the course of hours to several days. Delay in treatment can lead to serious outcomes. Inflammation of the meninges is assessed by analysing cerebrospinal fluid. Identifying the pathogen in cerebrospinal fluid is another way to diagnose meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid is collected by doing a lumbar puncture, which is an invasive test, and can be avoided if a physical examination excludes the diagnosis of meningitis. However, most physical examinations, such as nuchal rigidity, Kernig's test, and Brudzinski's test, are not sufficiently sensitive to exclude meningitis completely. Jolt accentuation of headache is a new and less well-recognised physical examination, which assesses meningeal irritation. It is judged as positive if the headache is exacerbated by rotating the head horizontally two or three times per second. A 1991 observational study initially reported high sensitivity of this examination to predict pleocytosis. Pleocytosis, an abnormally high cerebrospinal fluid sample white cell count, is an accepted indicator of nervous system infection or inflammation. Jolt accentuation of headache may therefore accurately rule out meningitis without the use of lumbar puncture. However, more recent cross-sectional studies have reported variable diagnostic accuracy."

391,32532478,"Burn disasters present a challenge not only to burn centers but the entire healthcare system. Most burn centers worldwide are unprepared to deal with a burn disaster as it is an uncommon event. We investigated the status of burn center preparedness in German-speaking countries to respond to a burn disaster. Self-administered survey questionnaires were sent to the directors of burn centers; the questions of survey used before in a similar way in Belgium were translated into German language. Of the 46 questioned burn centers, 32 (78%) responded, including all of the German adult burn centers. A clear difference in the preparation status of the burn centers in the three countries was observed due to geopolitical factors such as decentralized healthcare systems. However, the healthcare system is generally well-prepared concerning command, transfer, and capacity to provide sustained supplies to handle a massive influx of patients. Nevertheless, there are some gaps in the areas of planning and preparation, funding for disaster activities, and regular training of staff for burn disasters. We call for a unified burn disaster plan and increased cooperation between burn centers and civil defense regarding communication and training. We strongly recommend the implementation of a special disaster fund and telemedicine in disaster management to circumvent shortages in burn staff."
392,32533537,"Public health concerns regarding opioids and marijuana have implications for their medical use. This study examined use motives and perceived barriers in relation to opioid and marijuana use and interest in use among US adult cancer survivors. Self-administered surveys were distributed using social media to assess use motives and perceived barriers among participants living with cancer. Overall, 40.9% of cancer survivors reported current (past 30-day) use of opioids, 42.5% used marijuana, and 39.7% used both. The most common use motives for either/both drugs were to cope with pain and stress/anxiety (>70%). Highest-rated barriers to using either/both drugs were missing symptoms of worsening illness and not wanting to talk about their symptoms. Controlling for sociodemographics, binary logistic regression indicated that current opioid use was associated with reporting greater barriers to use (OR = 1.17, p = .011; Nagelkerke R-square = .934) and that current marijuana use was associated with reporting greater barriers to use (OR = 1.37, p = .003; Nagelkerke R-square = .921). Cancer survivors report various use motives and barriers to use regarding opioids and marijuana. While use motives and barriers for both drugs were similar, these constructs were differentially associated with use and interest in use across drugs. Understanding patients' perceptions about opioids and marijuana is an essential component to effectively manage symptoms related to a cancer diagnosis and improve quality of life for cancer survivors."

430,32586137,"Safe and reliable healthcare depends on access to health information that is accurate, valid, reliable, timely, relevant, legible and complete. National data collections are repositories of health and social care data and play a crucial role in healthcare planning and clinical decision-making. We describe the development of an evidence-informed multi-method quality improvement program aimed to improve the quality of health and social care data in Ireland. Specific components involved: development of guidance to support implementation of health information standards; review program to assess compliance with standards; and educating health information stakeholders about health data and information quality. Observations from implementation of the program indicate enhanced health information stakeholder awareness of, and increased adoption of information management standards. The methodology used in the review program has proved to be a robust approach to identify areas of good practice and opportunities for improvement in information management practices. There has been positive adoption of the program among organisations reviewed and acceptance of the proposed recommendations. Early indications are that this multi-method approach will drive improvements in information management practices, leading to an improvement in health and social care data quality in Ireland. Aspects of this approach may be adapted to meet the needs of other countries."

435,32599567,"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) belongs to the high resolution and high sensitivity surface imaging technologies. In this method force interactions between the tip and the surface are observed to characterize sample properties. In the so-called contact AFM (C AFM) mode the tip is brought into continuous contact with the sample. Significant progress in the AFM technology can be obtained, when the so-called active cantilever technology is implemented in the surface measurements. The built-in deflection actuator enables very precise excitation of the cantilever. Moreover, as the mass of the beam is very small the static beam displacement can be controlled in the wide frequency range. In the experiments, which we describe in this article, we applied the so called active electromagnetic cantilevers. They integrate a conductive loop which, when immersed in the magnetic field and biased with electric current, acts as an electromagnetic deflection actuator. The induced and precisely estimated Lorentz force, which is a function of bias current, cantilever geometry and magnetic field makes the cantilever deflect. Moreover, the probe stiffness can be calibrated with lower uncertainty as in the case of standard thermomechanical analysis. NZ AFM technology required application of a novel control algorithm, called PredPID, in which the cantilever bending caused by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) block maintaining the constant load force was predicted."

Recombinant Env trimers have been studied structurally, but characterization of Env embedded in intact virus membranes has been limited to low resolution. Here, we deploy cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to determine the structures of Env trimers on aldrithiol-2 (AT-2)-inactivated virions in ligand-free, antibody-bound and CD4-bound forms at subnanometer resolution. Tomographic reconstructions document molecular features consistent with high-resolution structures of engineered soluble and detergent-solubilized Env trimers. One of three conformational states previously predicted by smFRET was not observed by cryo-ET, potentially owing to AT-2 inactivation. We did observe Env trimers to open in situ in response to CD4 binding, with an outward movement of gp120-variable loops and an extension of a critical gp41 helix. Overall features of Env trimer embedded in AT-2-treated virions appear well-represented by current engineered trimers."

It has rapidly been injected with an 'all hands-on deck' approach, to facilitate the necessary adaptations required to reduce the spread of the virus and deliver frontline clinical care. Inevitably aspects of these changes have disrupted the delivery of medical education, notably clinical placements have been cancelled and social distancing guidelines prohibit face-to-face teaching. The training of future doctors is an essential part of this effort. Indeed, the emergence of a global health threat has underlined its continued importance. For medical educators and students alike, we have been presented with a challenge. Concurrently, this presents us with an impetus and opportunity for innovation. For some time now, a transformation in medical education has been called for, with an increasing recognition of the need to prepare students for the changing landscape of healthcare systems. This has included a focus on the use of technology-enhanced and self-directed learning. As a team of educators and clinicians in psychiatry, working in the School of Medicine and Medical Sciences (SMMS) in University College Dublin (UCD), we will share how we have responded. We outline the adaptations made to our 'Psychiatry' module and consider the influence this may have on its future delivery. These changes were informed by direct student input."

441,32623869,"Rheumatic manifestations are the most frequent extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, and they are responsible for a relevant reduction of quality of life. IBD is associated with a variety of musculoskeletal manifestations such as arthritis and non-inflammatory pain as well as with metabolic diseases, such as osteoporosis. Different imaging techniques (primarily ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and X-rays) can help the clinician to correctly identify the nature of manifestations and to treat the patient accordingly. Nowadays, in the setting of IBD-related arthritides, different drugs are available and can be effective on both articular and intestinal involvement. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary approach provides an early diagnosis and a better clinical outcome that can only be given from the recognition and consideration of the different EIMs. As for rheumatic manifestations, namely IBD-related arthritis, an early intervention allows to control disease activity and to prevent structural damage."

451,32677418,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, can affect not only the gastrointestinal tract but a wide spectrum of organs. The extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) are one of the most challenging aspect of IBD, playing a significant role for the lifetime care and the quality of life of patients. Ocular manifestations are the third most frequent EIMs, preceded by articular and dermatological ones. The aim of this narrative review is to describe the different types of ocular involvements, focusing on their clinical management. Uveitis and episcleritis are the most common ocular EIMs, differing for many aspects. Uveitis are unrelated with IBD activity and they even precede the onset of the intestinal disease, while episcleritis are common defined as a good mark of IBD activity. Pain is uncommon in most cases of episcleritis, while severe eye pain and photophobia are the most frequent onset of anterior uveitis. Less common but even more severe, are orbital pseudotumor or posterior segment involvement. Most of the ocular EIMs can be successfully treated with topic and oral steroids and the underlying therapy for IBD can reduce or cut out at all the recurrence of these manifestations. Symptoms are commonly not specific, in some cases being unnoticed for years leading to permanent ocular consequences. Cooperation between different specialists is crucial to avoid all the possible consequences of a non-treated EIMs, especially for ocular ones."
452,32677419,"Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) was introduced into clinical practice almost 20 years ago and, nowadays, it is an essential tool for the study of the small bowel. SBCE allows a radiation-free examination of the entire mucosal surface of the small bowel with high-quality images, limited invasivity and a good safety profile. Nevertheless, the main limitation of SBCE is the lack of any possible direct therapeutic intervention. Indications for SBCE have evolved throughout the years, from ""old"" ones such as suspected small bowel bleeding (still the main indication for SBCE) to newer ones such as refractory celiac disease, hereditary polyposis syndromes and Crohn's disease. Thus, nowadays SBCE has a key role in the diagnostic algorithms in many conditions. Furthermore, the introduction in the SBCE field of cutting-edge technologies, as artificial intelligence systems, is likely to shorten the reading time making SBCE even more effective and easy to perform. Preliminary data are extremely promising and solid evidence is being gathered by current studies."
453,32677420,"Focal liver lesions (FLLs) are a common finding during routine abdominal ultrasound (US). The differential diagnosis between diverse types of FLLs, especially between benign and malignant ones, is extremely important and can often be particularly challenging. Radiological techniques with contrast administration and/or liver biopsy are mostly necessary for establishing diagnosis, but they have several contraindications or complications. Due to limitations of these tools, there is urgent and still unmet need to develop a first line, non-invasive and simple method to diagnose FLLs. Elastography is an US-based imaging modality that provides information about the physical parameter corresponding to the tissue stiffness and can be considered a virtual biopsy. Several elastographic approaches have been developed, such as transient elastography, strain imaging and share wave imaging, which include point shear wave elastography and 2D shear wave elastography. These tools are already in use for evaluating liver fibrosis and in the assessment of focal lesions in other organs, like breast and thyroid gland. This review aims to assess the current evidence of different techniques based on elastography in the setting of FLLs, in order to evaluate accuracy, limitations and future perspectives. In particular, we focused on two contexts: the ability of discriminating between benign and malignant lesions, especially hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis, and the surveillance after percutaneous therapy. This could have a high clinical impact making elastography crucial to identify the appropriate management of FLLs."

CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1 are each proto-oncoproteins and dysregulation of CBM signaling, as a result of somatic gain-of-function mutation or chromosomal translocation, is a hallmark of multiple lymphoid malignancies including Activated B-cell Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma. Moreover, loss-of-function as well as gain-of-function germline mutations in CBM complex proteins have been associated with a range of immune dysregulation syndromes. A wealth of detailed structural information has become available over the past decade through meticulous interrogation of the interactions between CBM components. Here, we review key findings regarding the biochemical nature of these protein-protein interactions which have ultimately led the field to a sophisticated understanding of how these proteins assemble into high-order filamentous CBM complexes. To date, approaches to therapeutic inhibition of the CBM complex for the treatment of lymphoid malignancy and/or auto-immunity have focused on blocking MALT1 protease function. We also review key studies relating to the structural impact of MALT1 protease inhibitors on key protein-protein interactions."
463,32725170,"Despite its broad host range, the spotted lanternfly Lycorma delicatula (White), is known to have a marked preference for Ailanthus altissima. However, whether this polyphagous phloem feeder can complete its life cycle in the absence of A. altissima is unknown. We examined the performance of L. delicatula with and without access to A. altissima by tracking development, survival, host tree species association, and oviposition in large enclosures planted with Salix babylonica and Acer saccharinum along with either A. altissima or Betula nigra. We monitored enclosures from late May 2019 through June 2020. Lycorma delicatula survival was slightly higher in enclosures with A. altissima and 50% of individuals in A. altissima enclosures reached the adult stage ~6.5 d earlier than in enclosures without A. altissima. In the presence of A. altissima, nymphs were most frequently observed on this host while adults were found at similar frequencies on A. altissima and A. saccharinum. In the absence of A. altissima, nymphs were most frequently associated with S. babylonica and A. saccharinum, while adults were most often found on A. saccharinum. Females laid a total of 46 and 6 egg masses in enclosures with and without A. altissima, respectively, before freezing temperatures killed the remaining adults. The proportion of eggs that hatched per egg mass did not differ between treatments. Although L. delicatula can complete development and reproduce on other host species without access to A. altissima, fitness was reduced. These findings have implications for management that relies exclusively on treatment of A. altissima."

The essential and ubiquitous cofactor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) is synthesized in cells from adenosine triphosphate and l-methionine to yield exclusively the (S,S)-SAM diastereomer. (S,S)-SAM plays a crucial role as the primary methyl donor in transmethylation reactions important to the development and homeostasis of all organisms from bacteria to humans. However, (S,S)-SAM slowly racemizes at the sulfonium center to yield the inactive (R,S)-SAM, which can inhibit methyltransferases. Control of SAM homochirality has been shown to involve homocysteine S-methyltransferases in plants, insects, worms, yeast, and in ∼18 % of bacteria. Herein, we show that a recombinant protein containing a domain of unknown function (DUF62) from the actinomycete bacterium Salinispora tropica functions as a stereoselective (R,S)-SAM hydrolase (adenosine-forming).

502,32845332,"Graves' hyperthyroidism is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that stimulate the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), resulting in uncontrolled secretion of excessive thyroid hormone. Conventional treatments, including antithyroid medication, radioiodine, or surgery have remained largely unchanged for the past 70 years and either lack efficacy for many patients, or result in lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy, in the case of the latter 2 options. The demand for new therapeutic options, combined with greater insight into basic immunobiology, has led to the emergence of novel approaches to treat Graves' hyperthyroidism. The current therapies under investigation include biologics, small molecules, and peptide immunomodulation. There is a growing focus on TSHR-specific treatment modalities, which carry the advantage of eliciting a specific, targeted approach, with the aim of avoiding disruption of the functioning immune system. These therapies present a new opportunity to supersede the inadequate treatments currently available for some Graves' patients, offering hope of successful restoration of euthyroidism without the need for ongoing therapy. Several of these therapeutic options have the potential to translate into clinical practice in the near future. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the recent advances and various stages of development of the novel therapeutic approaches to treat Graves' hyperthyroidism."
503,32860729,"Therapeutic exercise is a recommended first-line treatment for patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA); however, there is little specific advice or practical resources to guide clinicians in its implementation. As the first in a series of projects by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International Rehabilitation Discussion Group to address this gap, we aim in this narrative review to synthesize current literature informing the implementation of therapeutic exercise for patients with knee and hip OA, focusing on evidence from systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials. Therapeutic exercise is safe for patients with knee and hip OA. Numerous types of therapeutic exercise (including aerobic, strengthening, neuromuscular, mind-body exercise) may be utilized at varying doses and in different settings to improve pain and function. Benefits from therapeutic exercise appear greater when dosage recommendations from general exercise guidelines for healthy adults are met. However, interim therapeutic exercise goals may also be useful, given that many barriers to achieving these dosages exist among this patient group. Theoretically-informed strategies to improve adherence to therapeutic exercise, such as patient education, goal-setting, monitoring, and feedback, may help maintain participation and optimize clinical benefits over the longer term. Sedentary behavior is also a risk factor for disability and lower quality of life in patients with knee and hip OA, although limited evidence exists regarding how best to reduce this behavior. Current evidence can be used to inform how to implement best practice therapeutic exercise at a sufficient and appropriate dose for patients with knee and hip OA."

512,32881694,"Although increasing hidden layers can improve the ability of a neural network in modeling complex nonlinear relationships, deep layers may result in degradation of accuracy due to the problem of vanishing gradient. Accuracy degradation limits the applications of deep neural networks to predict continuous variables with a small sample size and/or weak or little invariance to translations. Inspired by residual convolutional neural network in computer vision, we developed an encoder-decoder full residual deep network to robustly regress and predict complex spatiotemporal variables. We embedded full shortcuts from each encoding layer to its corresponding decoding layer in a systematic encoder-decoder architecture for efficient residual mapping and error signal propagation. We demonstrated, theoretically and experimentally, that the proposed network structure with full residual connections can successfully boost the backpropagation of signals and improve learning outcomes. This novel method has been extensively evaluated and compared with four commonly used methods (i.e., plain neural network, cascaded residual autoencoder, generalized additive model, and XGBoost) across different testing cases for continuous variable predictions. For model evaluation, we focused on spatiotemporal imputation of satellite aerosol optical depth with massive nonrandomness missingness and spatiotemporal estimation of atmospheric fine particulate matter [Formula: see text] (PM"
513,32882117,"Normal labor is identified as regular uterine contractions in addition to dilation and effacement of the cervix. It is necessary to define normal labor in order to delineate when a woman's labor pattern diverges from that observed in most women. Labor irregularities are subdivided into protraction disorders and arrest disorders. Identifying abnormal labor patterns and initiating appropriate interventions is essential because prolonged labor is associated with an increase in perinatal morbidity. The aim of this review was to delineate both normal labor progress and also discuss the current evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of protraction and arrest disorders. Many subtleties go into defining the boundaries of the first and second stages of labor. Historically, the Friedman curve established normal limits; but currently Zhang has advanced these definitions by accounting for current demographical characteristics and practice environments. The most significant variables for defining normal progress of labor are parity and regional anesthesia status. The most common causes of labor abnormalities are uterine inactivity, obesity, cephalopelvic disproportion and fetal malposition. Risks of extending the first and/or second stage of labor include postpartum hemorrhage, intraamniotic infection and potentially an increase in neonatal adverse outcomes. The management of labor disorders consists of oxytocin administration, amniotomy, intrauterine pressure catheter use and shared decision-making regarding proceeding with expectant management, operative vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery after weighing the risks and benefits of each option. The decision to extend the duration of labor is personalized for each mother-baby dyad and should be agreed upon depending on individual maternal and fetal circumstances."

The structures showed that CheY3-P interacts directly with a switch protein, FliM, inducing a major remodeling of another switch protein, FliG2, and altering its interaction with the torque generator. Our findings lead to a model in which the torque generator rotates in response to an inward flow of H"
519,32897091,"Physiological linkage refers to the degree to which peoples' physiological responses change in coordinated ways. Here, we examine whether and how physiological linkage relates to incidents of shared emotion, distinguished by valence. Past research has used an ""overall average"" approach and characterized how physiological linkage over relatively long time periods (e.g., 10-15 min) reflects psychological and social processes (e.g., marital satisfaction, empathy). Here, we used a ""momentary"" approach and characterized whether physiological linkage over relatively short time periods (i.e., 15 s) reflects shared positive emotion, shared negative emotion, or both, and whether linkage during shared emotions relates to relational functioning. Married couples (156 dyads) had a 15-min conflict conversation in the laboratory. Using behavioral coding, each second of conversation was classified into 1 of 4 emotion categories: shared positive emotion, shared negative emotion, shared neutral emotion, or unshared emotion. Using a composite of 3 peripheral physiological measures (i.e., heart rate, skin conductance, finger pulse amplitude), we computed momentary in-phase and antiphase linkage to represent coordinated changes in the same or opposite direction, respectively. We found that shared positive emotion was associated with higher in-phase and lower antiphase linkage, relative to the other 3 emotion categories. Greater in-phase physiological linkage during shared positive emotion was also consistently associated with higher-quality interactions and relationships, both concurrently and longitudinally (i.e., 5 to 6 years later). These findings advance our understanding of the nature of physiological linkage, the emotional conditions under which it occurs, and its possible associations with relational functioning.

521,32897388,"Metformin is a first-line therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, due to its robust glucose-lowering effects, well-established safety profile, and relatively low cost. While metformin has been shown to have pleotropic effects on glucose metabolism, there is a general consensus that the major glucose-lowering effect in patients with type 2 diabetes is mostly mediated through inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. However, despite decades of research, the mechanism by which metformin inhibits this process is still highly debated. A key reason for these discrepant effects is likely due to the inconsistency in dosage of metformin across studies. Widely studied mechanisms of action, such as complex I inhibition leading to AMPK activation, have only been observed in the context of supra-pharmacological (>1 mM) metformin concentrations, which do not occur in the clinical setting. Thus, these mechanisms have been challenged in recent years and new mechanisms have been proposed. Based on the observation that metformin alters cellular redox balance, a redox-dependent mechanism of action has been described by several groups. Recent studies have shown that clinically relevant (50-100 μM) concentrations of metformin inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis in a substrate-selective manner both in vitro and in vivo, supporting a redox-dependent mechanism of metformin action. Here, we review the current literature regarding metformin's cellular and molecular mechanisms of action."

530,32930608,"In the UK, doctors are instructed to keep accurate and clear medical records. This helps to ensure patient safety and is a professional expectation from the General Medical Council (GMC). However, operation note documentation is often reported to be sub-optimal despite general guidelines from the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCSeng) existing. These guidelines have sub-domains, e.g. estimated blood loss, which can inform the understanding of an intra-operative complication to help guide post-operative management. We conducted a closed loop audit of operative notes against these guidelines to ascertain if neurosurgeons in our department thought them applicable to neurosurgical practice. The first cycle was conducted retrospectively and the second cycle prospectively each conducted over a four-week period. In between each cycle the results were presented to the department: firstly, as an oral presentation and secondly as posters displayed in relevant clinical areas. Furthermore, the knowledge of operative note guidelines and their perceived importance by registrars were ascertained through a questionnaire. This highlighted that RCSeng sub-domains missing from operation notes scored lowest in terms of importance, and one sub-domain that remained recorded less frequently in both cycles was estimated blood loss. This reflects closed loop audits in general, plastic and orthopaedic surgery. Clearly, a generic guideline cannot be completely applicable to neurosurgical practice. This then begs the question if such a guideline is useful at all. Or should guidelines be specialty specific, as is the case in orthopaedic surgery, to improve compliance to a guideline more reflective of neurosurgical practice."
531,32930612,"Anatomical information and pathologies have been conveyed through the medium of medical illustrations for centuries. In the formative years of British neurosurgery, Professor Norman Dott (1897-1973) utilised medical illustrations as a means of documenting neurosurgical advances and conveying pathological-anatomical correlation. He commissioned a vast number of medical illustrations over the course of his career, ultimately producing a diverse collection of items, most of which is cared for by Lothian Health Services Archive (LHSA), Edinburgh, Scotland. In this study, the original material from Dott's personal collection was audited. Of 172 stand-alone drawings, 84 were categorised and analysed. The findings are a reflection of Dott's expertise as an academic and a surgeon. Spanning the years 1925-1968, a wide range of pathologies and procedures are depicted including intracranial aneurysms and their ligation, an area in which Dott was renowned for pioneering surgical advances. The collection stands as a testament to Dott's emphasis upon medical illustration to communicate the intricacies and complexities of his field, providing valuable insight into clinical and surgical practice in neurosurgery when the specialty was in its juvenescence. In order to illuminate the connections between biography and specialism that generated an extraordinary visual archive, this study considers the early life and work of Norman Dott and the influence of Harvey Cushing on Dott's prioritisation of visual documentation of surgical practice.

535,32938164,"Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas which are based on the malignant proliferation of skin-related T lymphocytes. The clinical appearance, as well as the course and the associated therapeutic approach, are sometimes very different between the different subtypes. Since allogeneic stem cell transplantation is currently the only curative option, and the morbidity and mortality are not insignificant, a therapy concept should be developed that considers its often rather indolent but chronic course. This concept should enable a good disease control with as few side effects as possible and preserve or improve the quality of life. In the early stages of the disease, skin-oriented therapies are generally used first before systemic and increasingly aggressive therapeutic agents are used as the disease progresses. Considering the current guidelines, literature and subjective experience, we summarize in this review how we treat cutaneous T-cell lymphomas."

537,32946388,"This article presents a simple yet effective algorithm for automatically transferring face colors in portrait videos. We extract the facial features and vectorize the faces in the input video using Poisson vector graphics, which encodes the low-frequency colors as the boundary colors of diffusion curves, and the high-frequency colors as Poisson regions. Then, we transfer the face color of a reference image/video to the first frame of the input video by applying optimal mass transport between the boundary colors of diffusion curves. Next the boundary color of the first frame is transferred to the subsequent frames by matching the curves. Finally, with the original or modified Poisson regions, we render the video using an efficient random-access Poisson solver. Thanks to our efficient diffusion curve matching algorithm, transferring colors for the vectorized video takes less than 1 millisecond per frame. Our method is particularly desired for frequent transfer from multiple references due to its information reuse nature. The simple diffusion curve matching also greatly improves the performance of video vectorization, since we only need to solve an optimization problem for the first frame. Since our method does not require correspondence between the reference image/video and the input video, it is flexible and robust to handle faces with significantly different geometries and postures, which often pose challenges to the existing methods. Moreover, by manipulating Poisson regions, we can enhance or reduce the highlight and contrast so that the reference color can fit into the input video naturally. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on image-to-video transfer and color swap in videos."

Our study included 14 surgery patients receiving tracheal intubation under general anaesthesia. Blood pressure was continuously measured using iNIBP monitoring. We recorded the percentage of successful iNIBP monitoring (measurements made without switching to dNIBP mode) during anaesthesia induction. We obtained 326 BP-measurements from 14 patients. The iNIPB mode was able to perform 90.9% of the measurements during the induction of general anaesthesia. iNIBP could determine BP even during periods of high blood pressure variability (31.6% [interquartile range; 22-40]). Our results validate the utility of iNIBP monitoring during the induction period of general anaesthesia, despite the rapid haemodynamic changes."
548,32981536,"Chronic foot ulcers are associated with a high risk of osteomyelitis, poor quality of life, amputations and disability. Few strategies improve their healing, and amputation rates in high-risk foot services are usually over 30 %. We conducted a randomised, inactive-placebo controlled, double-blind trial of 500 mg of slow-release vitamin C in sixteen people with foot ulcers in the Foot Wound Clinic at Westmead Hospital. Nine were randomised to control and seven to vitamin C. When serum vitamin C results become available at 4 weeks, all people with deficiency were offered both vitamin C and glucosamine tablets for the next 4 weeks. Patients without baseline deficiency continued their original assigned treatment. The primary outcome was percentage ulcer healing (reduction in ulcer size) at 8 weeks. Fifty percentage of subjects had baseline vitamin C deficiency, half having undetectable levels. Healing at 8 weeks was significantly better in the vitamin C group (median 100 v. -14 %, P = 0·041). Healing without amputation occurred in all patients in the vitamin C group. In contrast, 44 % of controls had not healed their ulcer at the end of the study period. Vitamin C improved healing of foot ulcers. Further studies are needed to determine whether there is a threshold effect for serum vitamin C above which therapy is ineffective and whether there are better or lesser responding subgroups. Because of its low cost and ease of access and administration, we recommend offering vitamin C therapy to all people who have chronic foot ulcers and potentially suboptimal vitamin C intake.

This review investigates the specifications that are typically being used in development of the latest TMMs. The imaging modalities that have been investigated focus around CT, mammography, SPECT, PET, MRI and ultrasound. Therapeutic applications discussed within the review include radiotherapy, thermal therapy and surgical applications. A number of modalities were not reviewed including optical spectroscopy, optical imaging and planar x-rays. The emergence of image guided interventions and multimodality imaging have placed an increasing demand on the number of specifications on the latest TMMs. Material specification standards are available in some imaging areas such as ultrasound. It is recommended that this should be replicated for other imaging and therapeutic modalities. Materials used within phantoms have been reviewed for a series of imaging and therapeutic applications with the potential to become a testbed for cross-fertilization of materials across modalities. Deformation, texture, multimodality imaging and perfusion are common themes that are currently under development."
551,32998127,"Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has been shown to allow for more accurate ion therapy treatment planning by improving the estimation of tissue stopping power ratio (SPR) relative to water, among other tissue properties. In this study, we measured and compared the accuracy of SPR values derived using both dual- and single-energy CT (SECT) based on different published conversion algorithms. For this purpose, a phantom setup containing either fresh animal soft tissue samples (beef, pork) and a water reference or tissue equivalent plastic materials was designed and irradiated in a clinical proton therapy facility. Dosimetric polymer gel was positioned downstream of the samples to obtain a three-dimensional proton range distribution with high spatial resolution. The mean proton range in gel for each tissue relative to the water sample was converted to a SPR value. Additionally, the homogeneous samples were probed with a variable water column encompassed by two ionization chambers to benchmark the SPR accuracy of the gel dosimetry. The SPR values measured with both methods were consistent with a mean deviation of 0.2%, but the gel dosimetry captured range variations up to 5 mm within individual samples.Across all fresh tissue samples the SECT approach yielded significantly greater mean absolute deviations from the SPR deduced using gel range measurements, with an average difference of 1.2%, compared to just 0.3% for the most accurate DECT-based algorithm. These results show a significant advantage of DECT over SECT for stopping power prediction in a realistic setting, and for the first time allow to compare a large set of methods under the same conditions."

555,33016669,"Pemphigus is a rare autoimmune disease of the skin, characterized by autoantibodies targeting adhesion proteins of the epidermis, in particular desmoglein 3 and desmoglein 1, that cause the loss of cell-cell adhesion and the formation of intraepidermal blisters. Given that these autoantibodies are both necessary and sufficient for pemphigus to occur, the goal of pemphigus therapy is the elimination of autoreactive B-cells responsible for autoantibody production. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was the first targeted B-cell therapy approved for use in pemphigus and is now considered the frontline therapy for new onset disease. One limitation of this treatment is that it targets both autoreactive and non -autoreactive B-cells, which accounts for the increased risk of serious infections in treated patients.

556,33022537,"Opioid/heroin use is an epidemic in the United States (US). Polysubstance use dramatically increases risk of adverse overdose outcomes, versus use of a single substance. Co-use of heroin and cocaine, known as ""speedballing,"" is associated with higher risk of overdose than use of either alone. It is not known whether co-use relative to use of either alone has increased in the US in recent years at a national level. If so, this may be one contributing factor to the increasing fatality rate associated with the US opioid epidemic. This study investigated the prevalence of use of each and co-use of heroin and cocaine from 2002 to 2017 in the US."

The role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory disorders is well-documented. IL-17 activates signaling through the IL-17 receptor, which induces other proinflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and neutrophil chemokines that are important for antifungal activity."
558,33026213,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a cluster of signs and symptoms that include memory loss, language disturbances, psychological and psychiatric changes and difficulty in carrying out daily activities. Although it may seem to be far from a dermatologic competence, the ageing of populations in industrialized and developing countries has changed things, making AD a multidisciplinary question. Indeed, this neurodegenerative disorder is not exclusively neurological, but rather may involve multiple tissues and organs. The abnormalities in metabolic and biochemical processes described in affected brains are also present in the skin and may condition specific dermatological manifestations. In fact, although a history of non-melanoma skin cancer is linked to a significantly reduced risk of developing AD, this is not so for melanoma. Several biological, social and environmental hypotheses can be advanced to explain these correlations. AD patients' memory problems and the partial inability to express an informed consent, could make a simple tumor excision challenging for a dermatologic surgeon. Moreover, attention should also be paid to the possibility of pharmacological interactions with AD therapies and to surgery timing. Observational studies have provided evidence for a non-spurious correlation between bullous pemphigoid (BP) and dementia. The demonstration of neurological isoforms of both BP180 and BP230 in the central nervous system has provided partial explanations for these findings and raised the question as to whether AD patients should be given accurate screening for BP and vice versa. Some adverse skin reactions have been observed with AD drugs and although mainly localized others are diffuse. Importantly, some of these drugs are available for administration in a patch or systemic form. When dealing with bedridden patients, the skin examination should be as complete as possible, since ulcer location is not only influenced by pressure and paratonia but also by spasticity, conditioning wounds in atypical sites."
559,33022093,"The potential aerosolised transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is of global concern. Airborne precaution personal protective equipment and preventative measures are universally mandated for medical procedures deemed to be aerosol generating. The implementation of these measures is having a huge impact on healthcare provision. There is currently a lack of quantitative evidence on the number and size of airborne particles produced during aerosol-generating procedures to inform risk assessments. To address this evidence gap, we conducted real-time, high-resolution environmental monitoring in ultraclean ventilation operating theatres during tracheal intubation and extubation sequences.

560,33026663,"Invertases are glycosidases applied for synthesis of alkyl glycosides that are important and effective surfactants. Stability of invertases in the environment with increased content of organic solvent is crucial for increase of productivity of glycosidases. Their stability is significantly influenced by N-glycosylation. However, yeast N-glycosylation pathways may synthesize plethora of N-glycan structures. A total natural crude mixture of invertase glycoforms (EINV) extracted from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was subfractionated by anion-exchange chromatography on industrial monolithic supports to obtain different glycoforms (EINV1-EINV3). Separated glycoforms exhibited different stabilities in water-alcohol solutions that are in direct correlation with the amount of phosphate bound to N-glycans. Observed differences in stability of different invertase glycoforms were used to improve productivity of methyl β-d-fructofuranoside (MF) synthesis. The efficiency and yield of MF synthesis were improved more than 50% when the most stabile glycoform bearing the lowest amount of phosphorylated N-glycans is selected and utilized. These data underline the importance of analysis of glycan structures attached to glycoproteins, demonstrate different impact of N-glycans on the surface charge and enzyme stability in regard to particular reaction environment, and provide a platform for improvement of yield of industrial enzymatic synthesis by chromatographic selection of glycoforms on monolithic supports."

567,33034434,"In this review, we recap current knowledge about non-desmoglein autoantigens in atypical forms of autoimmune pemphigus. More than 50 keratinocyte proteins, including adhesion molecules, receptors and enzymes as well as mitochondrial proteins can be targeted, leading to alterations in numerous intracellular signaling pathways. Patients with pemphigus herpetiformis feature various combinations of antibodies to desmogleins 1 and 3 and desmocollins 1-3. Pemphigus vulgaris patients who do not have antibodies to desmogleins develop typical clinical and histological features of pemphigus. Experimental results revealed synergy of different autoantibodies. Alterations of the keratinocyte adhesive function caused by a single antibody alone are reversible due to self-repair. Since composition of the pool of the most common pathogenic antibodies appears to be similar among pemphigus patients with or without anti-desmoglein antibodies, the atypical pemphigus represents a unique model for elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of autoimmunity against non-desmoglein antigens. Further studies of the immunopathology of atypical pemphigus should shed new lights on the pathophysiology of conventional variants of autoimmune pemphigus."

Far less is known about PD-1 function in regulatory T (T reg) cells. To study the role of PD-1 in T reg cells, we generated mice that selectively lack PD-1 in T reg cells. PD-1-deficient T reg cells exhibit an activated phenotype and enhanced immunosuppressive function. The in vivo significance of the potent suppressive capacity of PD-1-deficient T reg cells is illustrated by ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and protection from diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice lacking PD-1 selectively in T reg cells. We identified reduced signaling through the PI3K-AKT pathway as a mechanism underlying the enhanced suppressive capacity of PD-1-deficient T reg cells. Our findings demonstrate that cell-intrinsic PD-1 restraint of T reg cells is a significant mechanism by which PD-1 inhibitory signals regulate T cell tolerance and autoimmunity."

578,33051648,"Efficient and accurate alignment of DNA/RNA sequence reads to each other or to a reference genome/transcriptome is an important problem in genomic analysis. Nanopore sequencing has emerged as a major sequencing technology and many long-read aligners have been designed for aligning nanopore reads. However, the high error rate makes accurate and efficient alignment difficult. Utilizing the noise and error characteristics inherent in the sequencing process properly can play a vital role in constructing a robust aligner. In this article, we design QAlign, a pre-processor that can be used with any long-read aligner for aligning long reads to a genome/transcriptome or to other long reads. The key idea in QAlign is to convert the nucleotide reads into discretized current levels that capture the error modes of the nanopore sequencer before running it through a sequence aligner."

Accordingly, perturbations in nutrient sensing are tightly linked with human pathologies, particularly metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and other complications of metabolic syndromes. The conventional view is that amino acids are fundamental elements for protein and peptide synthesis, while recent studies have revealed that amino acids are also important bioactive molecules that play key roles in signaling pathways and metabolic regulation. Different pathways that sense intracellular and extracellular levels of amino acids are integrated and coordinated at the organismal level, and, together, these pathways maintain whole metabolic homeostasis. In this review, we discuss the studies describing how important sensing signals respond to amino acid availability and how these sensing mechanisms modulate metabolic processes, including energy, glucose, and lipid metabolism. We further discuss whether dysregulation of amino acid sensing signals can be targeted to promote metabolic disorders, and discuss how to translate these mechanisms to treat human diseases. This review will help to enhance our overall understanding of the correlation between amino acid sensing and metabolic homeostasis, which have important implications for human health."

585,33059346,"The pseudo-relativistic chiral electrons in 2D graphene and 3D topological semimetals, known as the massless Dirac or Weyl fermions, constitute various intriguing issues in modern condensed-matter physics. In particular, the issues linked to the Coulomb interaction between the chiral electrons attract great attentions due to their unusual features, namely, the interaction is not screened and has a long-ranged property near the charge-neutrality point, in clear contrast to its screened and short-ranged properties in the conventional correlated materials. In graphene, this long-range interaction induces an anomalous logarithmic renormalization of the Fermi velocity, which causes a nonlinear reshaping of its Dirac cone. In addition, for strong interactions, it even leads to the predictions of an excitonic condensation with a spontaneous mass generation. The interaction, however, would seem to be not that large in graphene, so that the latter phenomenon appears to have not yet been observed. Contrastingly, the interaction is probably large in the pressurized organic material"

MPI uses magnetic fields to generate a specific response from magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), to determine their spatial location non-invasively and without using ionizing radiation. One open challenge of MPI is to achieve further improvements in terms of sensitivity to translate the currently preclinical performed research into clinical applications. In this work, we study the noise and background signals of our preclinical MPI system, to identify and characterize disturbing signal contributions. The current limit of detection achieved with our device was determined previously to be20ng of iron. Based on the results presented in this work, we describe possible hardware and software improvements and estimate that the limit of detection could be lowered to about 1-2 ng. Additionally, a long-term analysis of the scanner performance over the last 3 years is presented, which proved to be an easy and effective way to monitor possible changes or damage of hardware components. All the presented results were obtained by analysing empty scanner measurements and the presented methodology can easily be adapted for different scanner types, to compare their performances."

The aim of this study is to characterise the clinical effects of metal artefacts on PET/CT in HNC and to inform decision-making concerning implementation of MAR techniques. We study a combined dual energy CT and inpainting-based metal artefact reduction (DECT-I-MAR) technique for PET/CT in three settings: (A) A dental phantom with a removable amalgam-filled tooth to evaluate the PET error in comparison to a known reference. (B) PET-positive patients with metallic implants to demonstrate the relationship between CT metal artefacts and PET error. (C) Metabolic tumour volumes delineated in PET-positive patients with metal implants to evaluate the clinical impact. In (A) DECT-I-MAR reduced the PET error significantly. In (B) we demonstrate an increasing PET error with increasing CT artefact severity in patients. In (C) it is shown that the presence of artefacts in the same axial slices as the tumour significantly decreases biomarker stability and increase delineation variability. This work shows the practical feasibility of DECT-I-MAR-based PET/CT imaging, and indicates a positive clinical impact of using the technique routinely for HNC patients. The impact of CT artefacts on PET is considerable, especially in workflows where quantitative PET biomarkers and tumour volumes are used. In such cases, and for patients with tumours in proximity of metals, we recommend that a MAR technique for PET/CT is employed."
594,33086214,"The performance of dual-ended readout depth-encoding PET detectors based on bismuth germanate (BGO) coupled to silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) arrays was measured for the first time and compared to lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) based detectors using the same readout. The BGO and LYSO crystal arrays all had a crystal pitch of 2.2 mm and were coupled to 8 × 8 SiPM arrays with a matching pitch of 2.2 mm, using a one-to-one coupling configuration. Three types of crystals with Toray reflector were used: polished LYSO, polished BGO, and unpolished BGO, and for two different crystal thicknesses of 20 mm and 30 mm. All the crystal elements in the BGO arrays were clearly resolved in the flood histogram. Better flood histograms were obtained using the LYSO arrays for a selected crystal thickness, and better flood histograms were obtained using the 20 mm thick crystal arrays for a selected crystal type. The average crystal level energy resolution and timing resolution for 20 mm polished LYSO, polished BGO and unpolished BGO crystals at their optimal SiPM bias voltage were 18.6 ± 1.3 % and 1.19 ± 0.20 ns, 17.8 ± 0.8 % and 4.43 ± 0.47 ns, and 18.0 ± 1.0 % and 4.68 ± 1.0 ns, respectively. Depth-of-interaction (DOI) resolution of the 20 mm polished LYSO array was 2.31 ± 0.17 mm and for the 20 mm unpolished BGO array was 3.53 ± 0.25 mm. However, polished BGO arrays with Toray reflector did not provide DOI information. Our key conclusion is that dual-ended readout depth-encoding 20 mm thick unpolished BGO detectors are good candidates for low-activity PET systems with small field-of-view and low timing performance requirements, such as preclinical or compact organ-dedicated PET systems, with the advantage over LYSO of having no background radiation and significantly lower cost."

596,33094812,"Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (Trk-B) belongs to the second largest family of membrane receptors, Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs). Trk-B is known to interact with three different neurotrophins: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Neurotrophin-4 (NT-4), and Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). All three neurotrophins are involved in survival and proliferation of neuronal cells, but each induces distinct signaling through Trk-B. We hypothesize that the different biological effects correlate with differences in the interactions between the Trk-B receptors, when bound to different ligands, in the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we use quantitative FRET to characterize Trk-B dimerization in response to NT-3 and NT-4 in live cells, and compare it to the previously published data for Trk-B in the absence and presence of BDNF. Our study reveals that the distinct Trk-B signaling outcomes are underpinned by both different configurations and different stabilities of the three ligand-bound Trk-B dimers in the plasma membrane."

The DNA Damage Response (DDR) is an intricate system involving damage recognition, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and ultimately cell fate determination, playing a central role in cancer etiology and therapy. Two primary therapeutic approaches involving DDR targeting include: combinatorial treatments employing anticancer genotoxic agents; and synthetic lethality, exploiting a sporadic DDR defect as a mechanism for cancer-specific therapy. Whereas, many DDR proteins have proven ""undruggable"", Fragment- and Structure-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD, SBDD) have advanced therapeutic agent identification and development. FBDD has led to 4 (with ∼50 more drugs under preclinical and clinical development), while SBDD is estimated to have contributed to the development of >200, FDA-approved medicines. Protein X-ray crystallography-based fragment library screening, especially for elusive or ""undruggable"" targets, allows for simultaneous generation of hits plus details of protein-ligand interactions and binding sites (orthosteric or allosteric) that inform chemical tractability, downstream biology, and intellectual property.

605,33125468,"This review takes an inclusive approach to microvascular dysfunction in diabetes mellitus and cardiometabolic disease. In virtually every organ, dynamic interactions between the microvasculature and resident tissue elements normally modulate vascular and tissue function in a homeostatic fashion. This regulation is disordered by diabetes mellitus, by hypertension, by obesity, and by dyslipidemia individually (or combined in cardiometabolic disease), with dysfunction serving as an early marker of change. In particular, we suggest that the familiar retinal, renal, and neural complications of diabetes mellitus are late-stage manifestations of microvascular injury that begins years earlier and is often abetted by other cardiometabolic disease elements (eg, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia). We focus on evidence that microvascular dysfunction precedes anatomic microvascular disease in these organs as well as in heart, muscle, and brain. We suggest that early on, diabetes mellitus and/or cardiometabolic disease can each cause reversible microvascular injury with accompanying dysfunction, which in time may or may not become irreversible and anatomically identifiable disease (eg, vascular basement membrane thickening, capillary rarefaction, pericyte loss, etc.). Consequences can include the familiar vision loss, renal insufficiency, and neuropathy, but also heart failure, sarcopenia, cognitive impairment, and escalating metabolic dysfunction. Our understanding of normal microvascular function and early dysfunction is rapidly evolving, aided by innovative genetic and imaging tools. This is leading, in tissues like the retina, to testing novel preventive interventions at early, reversible stages of microvascular injury. Great hope lies in the possibility that some of these interventions may develop into effective therapies."

609,33140622,"Alcohol-related liver disease is one of the most prevalent liver diseases worldwide and is the second most common indication for liver transplantation. Most transplant programs require 6 months of abstinence prior to transplantation; commonly referred to as the ""six-month rule."" According to this rule, the patients admitted for severe acute alcoholic hepatitis are not eligible for liver transplantation in most transplant centers. However, there is increasing evidence that if liver transplantation is performed in selected patients after the first episode of severe decompensation with no response to steroid therapy, it represents an effective treatment. In such selected patients, the post-transplant outcomes are good with survival rates that are significantly higher when compared with patients not responding to medical therapy and not transplanted. A multidisciplinary assessment, involving several stakeholders such as a transplant hepatologist, transplant surgeon, psychologist and psychiatrist is becoming mandatory to properly evaluate the candidate to liver transplantation for alcoholic liver diseases and severe acute alcoholic hepatitis. In the clinical setting of severe acute alcoholic hepatitis, further studies are needed for the identification of accepted selection clinical and psychosocial criteria that can provide the best long-term results. The early liver transplantation option should therefore be explored within strict criteria for this setting."
610,33140623,"Portal hypertension is a clinical syndrome characterized by an increase in the portal pressure gradient, defined as the gradient between the portal vein at the site downstream of the site of obstruction and the inferior vena cava. The most frequent cause of portal hypertension is cirrhosis. In patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension is the main driver of cirrhosis progression and development of hepatic decompensation (ascites, variceal hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy), which defines the transition from compensated to decompensated stage. In decompensated patients, treatments aim at lowering the risk of death by preventing further decompensation and/or development of acute-on-chronic liver failure. Decompensated patients often pose a complex challenge which typically requires a multidisciplinary approach.

Specifically, we discussed the indications and contraindications of transjugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunt and for the treatment of gastro-esophageal variceal hemorrhage in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (first section); we reviewed the use of interventional treatments in patients with hepatic vein obstruction (Budd-Chiari Syndrome) and in those with portal vein thrombosis (second section); and we briefly comment on the most frequent applications of selective splenic embolization in patients with and without underlying cirrhosis (third section)."
611,33138111,"Many bacteria require flagella for the ability to move, survive, and cause infection. The flagellum is a complex nanomachine that has evolved to increase the fitness of each bacterium to diverse environments. Over several decades, molecular, biochemical, and structural insights into the flagella have led to a comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of this fascinating nanomachine. Notably, X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have elucidated the flagella and their components to unprecedented resolution, gleaning insights into their structural conservation and adaptation. In this review, we focus on recent structural studies that have led to a mechanistic understanding of flagellar assembly, function, and evolution."

Enzymatic debridement has been approved by the European Medicines Agency for treating burn wounds affecting <15% total body surface area (TBSA). Data and evidence for the treatment of areas >15% TBSA in one session is scarce. The aim of this retrospective study was to retrospectively analyze off-label use of enzymatic debridement in a single burn center for large TBSA burns."
615,33145662,"This essay argues that Berger and Mohr's A Fortunate Man (1967) - comprising social observation and photographs of the rural practitioner, Dr. Sassall and his patients - enacts an embodied, intersubjective empathy called ""pain-work."" The book enacts ""pain-work"" through two strategies. Firstly, by conflating three ways of seeing - Berger's observation, Mohr's photography, and Sassall's medical gaze - it shows that the clinical encounter embodies objective vision through intersubjective pain. Secondly, it employs the concepts of recognition and witnessing to show how the subjectivity of the physician is distributed in his community. Thus, Berger and Mohr witness Sassall's witnessing of his patients; even as Sassall and his patients are constituted intersubjectively, so too are Berger, Mohr, and Sassall."
616,33146344,"This article reviews the most common non-psychiatric comorbidities associated with affective disorders, examining the implications of their possible bidirectional link. A narrative review was conducted on the association among the three most common non-psychiatric diseases in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder (obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases) in articles published from January 1994 to April 2020. The evidence suggests that obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases are highly prevalent in patients diagnosed with affective disorders. The presence of non-psychiatric comorbidities significantly worsens the therapeutic management and prognosis of affective disorders and vice versa. In many cases, these comorbidities may precede the onset of affective disorders, although in most cases they appear after it. The presence of these concurrent non-psychiatric diseases in an individual diagnosed with an affective disorder is associated with a more complex disease presentation and management. For professionals, the evidence unequivocally supports routine surveillance of comorbidities from a multidisciplinary approach."
617,33153744,"Currently, the apparition of new SARS-CoV, known as SARS-CoV-2, affected more than 34 million people and causing high death rates worldwide. Recently, several studies reported SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in hospital wastewater. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between humans via respiratory droplets, close contact and fomites. Fecal-oral transmission is considered also as a potential route of transmission since several scientists confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of infected patients, therefore its transmission via feces in aquatic environment, particularly hospital wastewater. Hospitals are one of the important classes of polluting sectors around the world. It was identified that hospital wastewater contains hazardous elements and a wide variety of microbial pathogens and viruses. Therefore, this may potentially pose a significant risk of public health and environment infection. This study reported an introduction about the Physical-chemical and microbiological characterization of hospital wastewater, which can be a route to identify potential technology to reduce the impact of hospital contaminants before evacuation. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in aqueous environment was reviewed. The knowledge of the detection and survival of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and hospital wastewater were described to understand the different routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which is also useful to avoid the outbreak of CoV-19. In addition, disinfection technologies used commonly for deactivation of SARS-CoV-2 were highlighted. It was revealed that, chlorine-containing disinfectants are the most commonly used disinfectants in this field of research. Meanwhile, other efficient technologies must be developed and improved to avoid another wave of the pandemic of COVID-19 infections."
618,33150398,"The discovery of leptin was intrinsically associated with its ability to regulate body weight. However, the effects of leptin are more far-reaching and include profound glucose-lowering and anti-lipogenic effects, independent of leptin's regulation of body weight. Regulation of glucose metabolism by leptin is mediated both centrally and via peripheral tissues and is influenced by the activation status of insulin signaling pathways. Ectopic fat accumulation is diminished by both central and peripheral leptin, an effect that is beneficial in obesity-associated disorders. The magnitude of leptin action depends upon the tissue, sex, and context being examined. Peripheral tissues that are of particular relevance include the endocrine pancreas, liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissues, immune cells, and the cardiovascular system. As a result of its potent metabolic activity, leptin is used to control hyperglycemia in patients with lipodystrophy and is being explored as an adjunct to insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes. To fully understand the role of leptin in physiology and to maximize its therapeutic potential, the mechanisms of leptin action in these tissues needs to be further explored."

Considering that Obesity is one of the main risk factors for developing a Ventral Hernia this will results that in the future we will experience a rise in those hernia in patients undergoing any abdominal surgery. There is no clarity on the best timing and choice for procedures. We are well aware also on the difficulties in hernia repair surgery and the relative outcome so adding obesity as co-factors amplify the challenges. In fact, today both general surgeons with expertise in abdominal wall repair and bariatric surgeons are faced with a new dilemma: the obese patient with an abdominal wall hernia. This article will briefly review the impact of obesity on the natural history of hernia, its associated complication, management strategies and outcome."

625,33162149,"According to the latest reports, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was successfully isolated from the excreta (stool and urine) of COVID-19 patients, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted through excreta contaminated water. As pit latrines and the use of untreated excreta as fertilizer were common in rural China, we surveyed 27 villages of Jiangxi and Hubei provinces and found that pit latrines could be a potential source of SARS-CoV-2 water pollution. Recently, bats have been widely recognized as the source of SARS-CoV-2. There were many possible intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, including pangolin, snake, bird and fish, but which one was still not clear exactly. Here, we proposed a hypothesis to illustrate the mechanism that SARS-CoV-2 might spread from the excreta of infected humans in pit latrines to potential animal hosts, thus becoming a sustainable source of infection in rural China. Therefore, we believe that abolishing pit latrines and banning the use of untreated excreta as fertilizer can improve the local living environment and effectively prevent COVID-19 and other potential waterborne diseases that could emanate from the excreta of infected persons. Although this study focused on rural areas in China, the results could also be applied to low-income countries, especially in Africa."

627,33164641,"Autophagic flux is a critical cellular process that is vastly under-appreciated in terms of its importance to human health. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that reductions in autophagic flux cause cancer and exacerbate chronic diseases, including heart disease and the pathological hallmarks of dementia. Autophagic flux can be increased by targeting nutrition-related biochemical signaling. To date, translation of this knowledge has been hampered because there has been no way to directly measure autophagic flux in humans. In this study we detail a method whereby human macroautophagic/autophagic flux can be directly measured from human blood samples. We show that whole blood samples can be treated with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from these samples could be used to measure autophagic machinery protein LC3B-II. Blocking of autophagic flux in cells while still in whole blood represents an important advance because it preserves genetic, nutritional, and signaling parameters inherent to the individual. We show this method was reproducible and defined LC3B-II as the best protein to measure autophagic flux in these cells. Finally, we show that this method is relevant to assess intra-individual variation induced by an intervention by manipulating nutrition signaling with an "

629,33165939,"The association of immunoglobulin G (IgG) glycosylation changes with various human diseases and physiological conditions is well established. Since the mechanistical explanation of the regulation of IgG glycosylation and its functional role in these various states is still missing, the eyes of the biomedical community are now turned towards animal models, which enable intervention studies necessary for conclusions on causality. Mice are recognized and used as a good experimental model for human IgG glycosylation. However, smaller blood volumes, low IgG concentrations at young ages (which are most often used in mice experiments) and multiple sampling protocols during the course of longitudinal studies would profit from a robust workflow for mouse IgG glycome analysis from minute amounts of starting material, collected through a simple sampling procedure. For this purpose, we have developed a protocol for analysis of total N-glycans of IgG isolated from mouse dried blood spots (DBS), which we report here. We show that mouse DBS are a good source of material for IgG N-glycan analysis by multiplexed capillary gel electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence (xCGE-LIF)."

633,33172983,"Matrix resorption is essential to the clearance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) after normal wound healing. A disruption in these processes constitutes a main component of fibrotic diseases, characterized by excess deposition and diminished clearance of fibrillar ECM proteins, such as collagen type I. The mechanisms and stimuli regulating ECM resorption in the lung remain poorly understood. Recently, agonism of dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1), which is predominantly expressed on fibroblasts in the lung, has been shown to accelerate tissue repair and clearance of ECM following bleomycin injury in mice. Therefore, we investigated whether DRD1 receptor signaling promotes the degradation of collagen type I by lung fibroblasts. For cultured fibroblasts, we found that DRD1 agonism enhances extracellular cleavage, internalization and lysosomal degradation of collagen I mediated by cathepsin K, which results in reduced stiffness of cell-derived matrices, as measured by atomic force microscopy.

However, existing methods for linking microscopy and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) have limited scalability. Here, we describe an upgraded version of Single Cell Optical Phenotyping and Expression (SCOPE-seq2) for combining single-cell imaging and expression profiling, with substantial improvements in throughput, molecular capture efficiency, linking accuracy, and compatibility with standard microscopy instrumentation. We introduce improved optically decodable mRNA capture beads and implement a more scalable and simplified optical decoding process. We demonstrate the utility of SCOPE-seq2 for fluorescence, morphological, and expression profiling of individual primary cells from a human glioblastoma (GBM) surgical sample, revealing relationships between simple imaging features and cellular identity, particularly among malignantly transformed tumor cells."

638,33179877,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a lymphangioproliferative disorder associated with Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) infection. Four clinical subtypes are recognized: classic, endemic, epidemic (HIV-related) and iatrogenic. KS diagnosis is based on clinical features, histopathological assessment, and HHV8 serology. Classic KS is usually skin-limited and has a chronic course, while the iatrogenic variant may show mucosal, nodal or visceral involvement. Clinical staging is fundamental to guide the management. Localized disease may be treated with different local therapies, even if there are no randomized trials comparing these different modalities. Aggressive, disseminated KS and cases with visceral involvement usually require systemic chemotherapy, most commonly vinblastine, bleomycin or paclitaxel. Iatrogenic KS needs immunosuppression tapering/withdrawal and, if possible, switch to m-TOR inhibitors in post-transplant KS. The present work by a panel of Italian experts provides guidelines on KS diagnosis and management based on a critical review of the literature and a long and extensive personal experience."
639,33179878,"Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune blistering disease, in which autoantibodies against epidermal cadherins, such as desmoglein (Dsg)1 and Dsg3, lead to the development of blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. Autoreactive CD4+ T cells are essential for the induction and perpetuation of the disease by interaction with B cells producing autoantibodies. PV has a strong genetic association with certain human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alleles with HLA-DRB1*04:02 and LA-DQB1*05:03 being the most prevalent in patients. Recently, genome-wide association studies have provided a new approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms, alongside the known association with HLA alleles. Loss of tolerance against Dsgs and other autoantigens is a critical event in the pathogenesis of PV. Epitope spreading contributes to the progression of PV, leading to an extension of the Dsg-specific autoimmune response to other molecular epitopes of autoantigens, such as desmocollins or muscarinic receptors. Alterations in CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells are thought to contribute to the development of PV representing a suitable target for therapeutic interventions. Several CD4+ T-cell subsets and cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of PV, while Th2 cells are the extensively studied population. Recently, other T cell subsets like T follicular helper cells and Th17 have gained attention as new potential players in PV pathogenesis. The involvement of local autoantibody production in the lesional skin of PV patients in tertiary lymphoid organs is currently discussed but not yet clarified. In this study, we reviewed the current knowledge about the development, characteristics and function of autoreactive T cells in pemphigus and present current new T cell-targeted therapeutic approaches."
640,33179882,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown unprecedented accuracy in digital image analysis, which can be harnessed for melanoma recognition through automated evaluation of clinical and dermatoscopic images. In experimental studies, modern CNN architectures perform single image analysis at the level of dermatologists and domain-experts, also for multiclass predictions including a multitude of possible diagnoses. This may not necessarily translate to good clinical performance, and reliable randomized controlled prospective clinical trials for modern CNNs are essentially missing. Weaknesses of CNNs are that limitations of available training image datasets propagate to limitations of CNN predictions, and they cannot provide a reliable estimate of uncertainty. Recent research focuses on human-computer collaboration, where gains in accuracy were measured even with imperfect CNNs. With missing academic and clinical agreement on equivocal melanocytic lesions, fully automating histologic assessment of them with CNNs appear problematic, and applications in the near future are probably limited to supporting, referencing or recommendation roles."
641,33186014,"Bacterial cell surface glycans are quintessential drug targets due to their critical role in colonization of the host, pathogen survival, and immune evasion. The dense cell envelope glycocalyx contains distinctive monosaccharides that are stitched together into higher order glycans to yield exclusively bacterial structures that are critical for strain fitness and pathogenesis. However, the systematic study and inhibition of bacterial glycosylation enzymes remains challenging. Bacteria produce glycans containing rare sugars refractory to traditional glycan analysis, complicating the study of bacterial glycans and the identification of their biosynthesis machinery. To ease the study of bacterial glycans in the absence of detailed structural information, we used metabolic glycan labeling to detect changes in glycan biosynthesis. Here, we screened wild-type versus mutant strains of the gastric pathogen "
642,33196635,"Improving maternal and perinatal care is a global priority. Simulation training and novel applications of simulation for intrapartum care may help to reduce preventable deaths worldwide. Evaluation studies have published details of the effectiveness of simulation training for obstetric emergencies, exploring clinical and non-clinical factors as well as the impact on patient outcomes (both maternal and neonatal). This review summarized the many uses of simulation in obstetric emergencies from training to assessment. It also described the adaption of training in low-resource settings and the evidence behind the equipment recommended to support simulation training. The review also discussed novel applications for simulation such as its use in the development of a new device for assisted vaginal birth and its potential role in Cesarean section training. This study analyzed the financial implications of simulation training and how this may impact the delivery of such training packages, considering that simulation should be developed and utilized as a key tool in the development of safe intrapartum care in both emergency and non-emergency settings, in innovation and product development."
643,33196725,"The removal of excessive blood lead ions (Pb2+) is very important to human health, but current effective removal technology is still lacking because of the complex existence state of Pb2+ in blood, which can be attributed to the fact that most of the blood Pb2+ is combined with haemoglobin (Hb) located in red blood cells (RBCs). Here, a new type of magnetic mesoporous silica/ε-polylysine nanomotor-based remover (MMS/P NR) with abundant chelation sites was designed, synthesized and used to remove Pb2+ from blood. The magnetic core can make the nanocomposites become nanomotors with autonomous movement under an external variable magnetic field, which can effectively improve the contact probability between the MMS/P NRs and Pb2+-contaminated Hb in RBCs. The amino rich ε-polylysine (ε-PL) was used as the co-template of mesoporous silica. Mesoporous channels can provide a confinement effect for Pb2+-contaminated Hb to stabilize the captured blood Pb2+. The movement behavior of the MMS/P NRs in and out of RBCs and the capture mechanism of Pb2+ in the blood were studied. The results indicate that the MMS/P NRs we propose have good blood compatibility, low cytotoxicity, magnetic properties, autonomous movement ability and recyclability under the condition of an external magnetic field. Moreover, compared with the experimental conditions without an external variable magnetic field (0.01485 mg g-1), the MMS/P NRs show a higher blood Pb2+ removal ability under the condition of an external variable magnetic field (0.05525 mg g-1). The design strategy of this remover based on nanomotor technology has great potential in the future medical treatment of heavy metal poisoning."

646,33203202,"Child injury from bike accidents is a significant component of morbidity, mortality and health expenditure in many countries. Universal use of bicycle helmets by children could prevent between 135 and 155 deaths, and between 39,000 and 45,000 head injuries annually. Surprisingly, epidemiologic data indicate a worldwide low prevalence of helmet use. A global view on the law on the compulsory use of safety helmets involving 58 different countries is provided in order to bring this critical debate back to the table. A broad search using ""bicycle-related injuries,"" ""bicycle helmet,"" ""bicycle helmet legislation"" and ""compulsory bicycle helmet law by countries"" was performed in order to identify and select the most pertinent information on the issue as well as all the information available on bicycle helmet law by countries. The papers identified permitted us to assess the main topics related to the use of bicycle helmets discussed over the years which are still relevant and without consensus even today, as well as alphabetically enlist the approach of 58 countries to the compulsory helmet law. Our review on the many faces of the bicycle helmet use (pros and cons), personal aspects, head injuries, legislation, promotion, socioeconomic influence, and finally a global view on the law on the compulsory use of safety helmets allowed us to bring here many suggestions and a few conclusions, mainly because ""to helmet or not to helmet"" should not be a question anymore. A universal consensus on their compulsory use has to be achieved in order to improve children's safety."
647,33210617,"Modern single cell experiments have revealed unexpected heterogeneity in apparently functionally 'pure' cell populations. However, we are still lacking a conceptual framework to understand this heterogeneity. Here, we propose that cellular memories-changes in the molecular status of a cell in response to a stimulus, that modify the ability of the cell to respond to future stimuli-are an essential ingredient in any such theory. We illustrate this idea by considering a simple age-structured model of stem cell proliferation that takes account of mitotic memories. Using this model we argue that asynchronous mitosis generates heterogeneity that is central to stem cell population function. This model naturally explains why stem cell numbers increase through life, yet regenerative potency simultaneously declines."
648,33211626,"Infants may develop congenital tuberculosis from an infectious mother or acquire the disease postnatally by contact with an infectious adult. Delayed diagnosis is common, especially in infants under 1 year of age, and, if unrecognised, there is an increased risk of death. A 2.5-month-old boy presented with respiratory distress, small inhomogeneous opacities in both lungs and hepatosplenomegaly mimicking sepsis. He had received BCG vaccination and there was no history of contact with tuberculosis (TB). He had had fever since 1 month of age for which there had been several outpatient visits. Gastric aspirate cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) confirmed TB and sonological evaluation demonstrated multiple granulomata in the liver and spleen, and a liver biopsy supported TB. He responded well to 12 months of anti-tuberculous treatment. The mother's tuberculin test, chest radiograph and endometrial biopsy showed no evidence of TB. There was no history of tuberculous contact with close family members. Despite the lack of proof of current tuberculous TB infection in the mother, it is likely that the infant had congenital TB."
649,33215908,"Intrapartum hypoxic events most commonly occur in low-risk pregnancies with appropriately grown fetuses. Continuous intrapartum monitoring by means of cardiotocography has not demonstrated a reduction in the frequency of adverse perinatal outcome but has been linked with an increase in the caesarean section rate, particularly among women considered at low risk. Available data from the literature suggests that abnormalities in the uterine artery Doppler and in the ratio between fetal cerebral and umbilical Doppler (i.e. cerebroplacental ratio [CPR]) are associated with conditions of subclinical placental function occurring in fetuses who have failed to achieve their growth potential regardless of their actual size. In this review we summarize the available evidence on the use of intrapartum Doppler ultrasound for the fetal surveillance during labor and the identification of the fetuses at risk of intrapartum distress."
650,33222429,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. HCC occurs predominantly in patients with underlying chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and it presents a poor prognosis in advanced stage. Since its approval, for the following 10 years, sorafenib remained the only systemic agent with proven clinical efficacy for patients with advanced HCC. Recently, more drugs have been studied and several advances in first‑line and second‑line treatment options should yield significant improvements in survival. Lenvatinib, another tyrosine‑kinase inhibitor, was found to be non-inferior to sorafenib in terms of overall survival (OS), with significantly better progression-free survival and objective response rate (ORR). The tyrosinekinase inhibitors, regorafenib and cabozantinib, were shown to significantly improve survival in the second‑line setting after sorafenib failure. Ramucirumab, a VEGF inhibitor, can also improve survival in the second‑line setting among patients with AFP≥400 ng/dL. Moreover, good efficacy was seen in phase I/II trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy. Ongoing trials are evaluating combination immune checkpoint inhibitor and tyrosine‑kinase inhibitors or VEGF inhibitors for increasing overall survival in this patient population with advanced HCC."

652,33222431,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major health problem worldwide, with approximatively 240 million people living with a chronic HBV infection. HBV chronic infection remains the major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide, with more than half of HCC patients being chronic HBV carriers, even if underlying mechanisms of tumorigenesis are not totally understood. HBV-related HCC can be prevented by reducing the exposure to HBV by vaccination or by treatment of CHB infection. Current treatment of CHB are Peg-IFN alpha and oral NUCs. Treating HBV infection, either with IFN or NUCs, substantially reduces the risk of HCC development, even if antiviral therapy fails to completely eliminate HCC risk. Among treated patients, cirrhosis, HBeAg negative at baseline and failure to remain in virological remission were associated with an increased risk of HCC. The reduction of the risk of developing HCC during antiviral therapy is largely dependent upon the maintenance of virological remission, since viral load is found to be the most important factor leading to cirrhosis and its complications, including liver cancer development. The question whether Peg-IFN-alpha is superior to NUCs and whether there is a superior agent among NUCs is still controversial. Several studies demonstrated that antiviral therapy with NUCs could reduce the risk of HCC recurrence after curative treatment of HBV-related HCC."
653,33222432,"Drug induced liver injury (DILI) is a necro-inflammatory liver disease caused by several drugs commonly used in clinical practice, herbs and dietary supplements prescribed for medical purposes. Despite its rarity, it represents the major cause of acute liver failure (ALF) requiring liver transplantation in USA and its frequency is increasing in Europe too. Two types of drug induced liver injury have been recognized: intrinsic and idiosyncratic. Predisposing factors may be classified in environmental, drugs- and individual- related risk factors, with the latter further distinguished in genetics and non-genetics. The liver injury can present with a hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed pattern of disease. A definitive diagnosis of DILI is, nowadays, one of the main challenging issue in the management of these patients. Diagnosis often is based on suspicion derived from clinical history, biochemical exams and eventually on histological examination from liver biopsy. Score system may be helpful in these setting and new markers are gaining more prominence. Evaluation for liver transplantation is indicated when spontaneous resolution does not occur or in cases of ALF. Overall, the 1-year survival rate following liver transplantation is lower than that seen in patients who have been transplanted for chronic liver failure; however long-term survival is higher compared to other indications."

655,33228340,"Pemphigus is a rare autoimmune blistering disease which manifests with painful erosions and blisters of the skin and mucosa. This disorder is caused by autoantibodies attacking desmosomal proteins, necessary for cell-cell contact stability and epidermal integrity. Desmoglein (Dsg) 1 and Dsg3 are the two major target antigens in pemphigus. Yet, many other target proteins, which have been described over the years, seem to be involved in the loss of epidermal integrity. Clinical examination, combined to serological advances and detection of targeted antigens, permitted to differentiate among several pemphigus subtypes, in which pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus are the most common. Nowadays, serological analysis in pemphigus is a fundamental step of the diagnostic algorithm. This is based on analysis of clinical symptoms, histopathological examination of lesional skin, detection of tissue bound and circulating antibodies by direct and indirect immunofluorescence, and determination of target antigens either by enzyme-linked immunosorbent essay (ELISA) or by western blot analysis. A correct and exhaustive diagnostic algorithm is fundamental to characterize pemphigus subtypes, which lastly permits to adopt a correct treatment approach. Moreover, quality and quantity of circulating antibodies in patient's sera deliver important information regarding clinical course, disease severity and treatment response; thus, relevantly affecting physician's decision. To facilitate this process, ""easy-to-perform"" diagnostic kits with high sensitivity and specificity are being commercialized. In this review, we focus on available methods and established assays to correctly detect circulating autoantibodies in pemphigus. Moreover, we discuss subtype specific serological peculiarities in the five most relevant subtypes (pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus vegetans, paraneoplastic pemphigus and intercellular IgA dermatosis (also called as IgA pemphigus)."

657,33237255,"Lack of diversity regarding genetic and environmental backgrounds weakens the generalization and clinical applicability of research findings on psychotic disorders. Notably, Latin Americans have been generally neglected in genetic studies, comprising less than 2% of genome-wide association study samples. But Latin American populations represent a unique opportunity for research, given the exceptionally high ethnic admixture of this group. Increasing genetic diversity is essential to improve the fine mapping of known regions associated with psychotic disorders, discover novel genetic associations, and replicate studies. Additionally, Latin America is characterized by massive social, political, and economic inequalities, all known risk factors for mental health issues, including psychotic disorders. This article aims to 1) discuss the challenges and advantages of studying Latin America's particular genetic makeup and environmental context; 2) review previous studies conducted in the region; and 3) describe three Latin American research initiatives in progress: the Neuropsychiatric Genetics of Psychosis in Mexican Populations (NeuroMEX), the Paisa, and the Latin American Network for the Study of Early Psychosis (ANDES) studies."
658,33237768,"Cellular membranes are densely covered by proteins. Steric pressure generated by protein collisions plays a significant role in shaping and curving biological membranes. However, no method currently exists for measuring steric pressure at membrane surfaces. Here, we developed a sensor based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), which uses the principles of polymer physics to precisely detect changes in steric pressure. The sensor consists of a polyethylene glycol chain tethered to the membrane surface. The polymer has a donor fluorophore at its free end, such that FRET with acceptor fluorophores in the membrane provides a real-time readout of polymer extension. As a demonstration of the sensor, we measured the steric pressure generated by a model protein involved in membrane bending, the N-terminal homology domain (ENTH) of Epsin1. As the membrane becomes crowded by ENTH proteins, the polymer chain extends, increasing the fluorescence lifetime of the donor. Drawing on polymer theory, we use this change in lifetime to calculate steric pressure as a function of membrane coverage by ENTH, validating theoretical equations of state. Further, we find that ENTH's ability to break up larger vesicles into smaller ones correlates with steric pressure rather than the chemistry used to attach ENTH to the membrane surface. This result addresses a long-standing question about the molecular mechanisms of membrane remodeling. More broadly, this sensor makes it possible to measure steric pressure in situ during diverse biochemical events that occur on membrane surfaces, such as membrane remodeling, ligand-receptor binding, assembly of protein complexes, and changes in membrane organization."
659,33238664,"The journey of human labor involves hypoxic and mechanical stresses as a result of progressively increasing frequency, duration and strength of uterine contractions and resultant compression of the umbilical cord. In addition, occlusion of the spiral arteries during myometrial contractions also leads to repetitive interruptions in the utero-placental circulation, predisposing a fetus to progressively worsening hypoxic stress as labor progresses. The vast majority of fetuses are equipped with compensatory mechanisms to withstand these hypoxic and mechanical stresses. They emerge unharmed at birth. However, some fetuses may sustain an antenatal injury or experience a chronic utero-placental insufficiency prior to the onset of labor. These may impair the fetus to compensate for the ongoing hypoxic stress secondary to ongoing uterine contractions. Non-hypoxic pathways of neurological damage such as chorioamnionitis, fetal anemia or an acute fetal hypovolemia may potentiate fetal neurological injury, especially in the presence of a super-imposed, additional hypoxic stress. The use of utero-tonic agents to induce or augment labor may increase the risk of hypoxic-ischemic injury. Clinicians need to move away from ""pattern recognition"" guidelines (""normal,"" ""suspicious,"" ""pathological""), and apply the knowledge of fetal physiology to differentiate fetal compensation from decompensation. Individualization of care is essential to optimize outcomes."

Slight variations in the amount of the initial target molecule or in early amplifications are likely responsible for these deviations. Commonly used 4- and 5-parameter sigmoidal models appear to be particularly susceptible to this issue, often displaying patterns of autocorrelation in the residuals. The presence of this phenomenon, even for technical replicates, suggests that these parametric models may be misspecified. Specifically, they do not account for the sequential dependent nature of the amplification process that underlies qPCR fluorescence measurements."

669,33249817,"Safe management of the second stage of labor is important. Wait for spontaneous delivery, operative vaginal deliveries and second stage cesarean sections are all options when prolonged second stage occurs. The important question is which option to choose. Fetal head station and fetal head position are used to decide mode of delivery; this has traditionally been decided by performing a digital vaginal examination. Studies have shown that theses clinical examinations of both fetal head station and position are unreliable and that ultrasound might be better option. The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) published in 2018 guidelines on intrapartum ultrasound and recommends that ultrasound is performed for ascertainment of fetal head position and station before considering or performing an instrumental vaginal delivery for slow progress or arrested labor in the second stage. The determination of the fetal head position, fetal head station and the movement of the fetal head can easily be determined with the help of ultrasound and can help the clinicians in making the right decision on how to proceed when prolonged second stage of labor is diagnosed."
670,33249818,"Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) are one of the most common causes of anal incontinence (AI) in women of reproductive age and can have a significant impact on quality of life. However, many women do not report symptoms to their physicians because of embarrassment and shame. Therefore, prevention and diagnosis of the tear is essential. Diagnostic strategies have evolved considerably in recent years, with an increase in prevalence of OASIS as a consequence. The use of 3D endoanal (3D-EAUS) and 4D transperineal ultrasound (4D-TPUS), in addition to standard clinical examination have enhanced the detection of OASIS. Once identified, adequate repair by a skilled practitioner and optimal postpartum management should be ensured in order to reduce the risk of anal incontinence.

672,33249439,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), a rare tumor syndrome that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, is continuing to raise great interest for endocrinology, gastroenterology, surgery, radiology, genetics, and molecular biology specialists. There have been 2 major clinical practice guidance papers published in the past 2 decades, with the most recent published 8 years ago. Since then, several new insights on the basic biology and clinical features of MEN1 have appeared in the literature, and those data are discussed in this review. The genetic and molecular interactions of the MEN1-encoded protein menin with transcription factors and chromatin-modifying proteins in cell signaling pathways mediated by transforming growth factor β/bone morphogenetic protein, a few nuclear receptors, Wnt/β-catenin, and Hedgehog, and preclinical studies in mouse models have facilitated the understanding of the pathogenesis of MEN1-associated tumors and potential pharmacological interventions. The advancements in genetic diagnosis have offered a chance to recognize MEN1-related conditions in germline MEN1 mutation-negative patients. There is rapidly accumulating knowledge about clinical presentation in children, adolescents, and pregnancy that is translatable into the management of these very fragile patients. The discoveries about the genetic and molecular signatures of sporadic neuroendocrine tumors support the development of clinical trials with novel targeted therapies, along with advancements in diagnostic tools and surgical approaches. Finally, quality of life studies in patients affected by MEN1 and related conditions represent an effort necessary to develop a pharmacoeconomic interpretation of the problem. Because advances are being made both broadly and in focused areas, this timely review presents and discusses those studies collectively."

674,33249821,"COVID-19 was declared to be a pandemic due to the rapid increase of cases around the world, including the number of pregnant women. Data about vertical transmission of COVID-19 are still limited and controversial: in most cases, although a positive mother, the virus could not be isolated in amniotic fluid, cord blood, breast milk or neonatal throat swab in these patients. No data have been published about possible intrauterine sonographic signs of infection. A pregnant woman was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 at 35+5 weeks of gestation and managed conservatively at home. At transabdominal ultrasound at 38+3 weeks, fetal bowel and gallbladder calcifications were noted. CMV and other infectious agents were ruled out; an iterative caesarean section was performed at 38+5 weeks without complications. Placenta resulted negative for SARS-CoV-2; the umbilical cord blood sample was IgG positive and IgM negative as per maternal infection. The baby developed respiratory distress syndrome requiring endotracheal surfactant administration and nasal-CPAP for one day but nasopharyngeal swabs at birth and after 48 hours were SARS-CoV-2 negative. Neonatal abdominal ultrasound showed normal liver, acalculous gallbladder with mild parietal thickening. The baby was discharged in good conditions. Although gallbladder calcifications and echogenic bowel are highly suspicious of viral infection and were thought to be due to the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, these findings were not corroborated by the results of our diagnostic tests; these sonographic findings might represent a false positive of fetal infection in mother affected by COVID-19 since vertical transmission appears to be rare."

681,33258402,"We have previously reported that not only transcripts of RNA polymerase II (pol II), but also one type of RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III), undergo AAUAAA-dependent polyadenylation. Such an unusual feature is inherent in Short Interspersed Elements (SINEs) from genomes of certain mammals. For polyadenylation of its transcript, SINE should contain, besides an AATAAA hexamer and a transcription terminator, two specific regions: β, located downstream of box B of a promoter, and τ, preceding AATAAA. Here, using nucleotide substitutions in SINEs B2 (mouse) and Ves (bat), we identified nucleotides of β regions necessary for polyadenylation of their transcripts. These sequences (β signals) are the following: ACCACATgg in B2 and GGGCATGT in Ves. Using this approach, we identified τ signal of SINE B2 (GCTACagTGTACTTACAT), where TGTA tetramer is most important for polyadenylation. In Ves, τ region is a long polypyrimidine motif which is able to interact with PTB protein in Ves transcripts. We demonstrated by knockdown that B2 and Ves transcript polyadenylation is performed by canonical poly(A) polymerase with the participation of proteins CSPF-160 and Fip1, the known factors of mRNA polyadenylation. We also showed that a factor CFIm partaking in polyadenylation of many mRNAs, is involved only in polyadenylation of B2 transcripts. CFIm seems to interact with τ signal of В2 RNA and thereby facilitates the recruiting of other proteins engaged in polyadenylation. Thus, SINEs utilize at least some proteins involved in polyadenylation of pol II transcripts to polyadenylate their pol III transcripts."
682,33259725,"Purpose This clinical focus article is a companion to the work of Erdman et al. (2019), in which we described the rationale, development, and implementation of the standard-of-care protocol used in the Tinnitus Retraining Therapy Trial (TRTT), a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, definitive efficacy trial of tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT). We now describe the historical background, development, and standardized implementation and delivery of the TRT counseling protocol (tinnitus counseling [TC]) used in the TRTT. TC is conjectured to be the key component in the TRT protocol for initiating the habituation process that reduces the response to the tinnitus signal and, ultimately, reduces its impact. In the TRTT, participants assigned to receive TC achieved > 30% reduction in the impact of tinnitus. Method and Results The design and implementation of standardized treatments in multisite randomized controlled trials presents many challenges for investigators. Here, subsequent to presenting the background, rationale, and the TRT protocol model, we describe the development, refinement, and training/certification for standardized delivery of TC in the TRTT. The primary challenges encountered while distilling and streamlining TC for standardized delivery across multiple clinicians and their replacements at six participating military treatment centers in the TRTT are considered, and the resulting counseling protocol is detailed. Conclusions The standardized and streamlined TC used in the TRTT was successful for treating debilitating tinnitus among persons with functionally adequate unaided hearing sensitivity. The structured TC protocol described here appears to be the main determinant of the significant and sizable TRT treatment effects measured in the TRTT, thus bolstering the merits of this standardized counseling approach as one model for the clinical implementation of TRT for the treatment of primary tinnitus."

685,33264502,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of insurance and neighborhood SES (nSES) on chemotherapy completion and overall mortality among participants in breast cancer clinical trials. The data sources for this study were two adjuvant breast cancer trials (ECOG E1199 and E5103) collectively including 9790 women. Insurance status at trial registration was categorized into private, government (Medicaid, Medicare, and other government type insurance), and self-pay. An Agency for Healthcare Research Quality (AHRQ) nSES index was calculated using residential zip codes linked to county level data on occupation, income, poverty, wealth, education, and crowding. Logistic regression and Cox Proportional Hazard models estimated odds ratios (OR) for chemotherapy treatment completion and hazard ratios (HR) for mortality, respectively, for insurance status and nSES. The models adjusted for: race, age, tumor size, nodal status, hormone receptor status, and primary surgery. The majority of patients had private insurance at trial registration: E1199: 85.6% (4154/4854) and E5103: 82.4% (3987/4836); median SES index was 53.8 (range: 41.8-66.8) and 54.1 (range: 44.5-66.1), respectively. Patients with government insurance were less likely to complete chemotherapy treatment (E1199 OR (95%CI): 0.73 (0.57-0.94); E5103 0.76 (0.64-0.91)) and had an increased risk of death (E1199 HR (95%CI): 1.44 (1.22-1.70); E5103 1.29 (1.06-1.58)) compared to the privately insured patients. There was no association between nSES and chemotherapy completion or overall mortality. Patients with government insurance at trial registration appeared to face barriers in chemotherapy completion and had a higher overall mortality compared to their privately insured counterparts."
686,33264574,"Purpose Auditory threshold estimation using the auditory brainstem response or auditory steady state response is limited in some populations (e.g., individuals with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder [ANSD] or those who have difficulty remaining still during testing and cannot tolerate general anesthetic). However, cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) can be recorded in many such patients and have been employed in threshold approximation. Thus, we studied CAEP estimates of auditory thresholds in participants with normal hearing, sensorineural hearing loss, and ANSD. Method We recorded CAEPs at varying intensity levels to speech (i.e., /ba/) and tones (i.e., 1 kHz) to estimate auditory thresholds in normal-hearing adults ("
687,33264578,"Purpose This dual-aim study was intended to develop and validate a new fitting paradigm for over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids. Aim 1 was undertaken to create a limited set of evidence-based preconfigured gain-frequency responses (""presets"") for use in OTC devices. Aim 2 tested the efficacy of the presets relative to best-practice verification and determined the best method(s) for older adults to self-select amplification from the set. Method In Aim 1, audiometry data from 267 older adults with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database. Using these data and the National Acoustic Laboratories-Non-Linear 2 (NAL-NL2) prescriptive formula, a set of four presets were created that can fit a large percentage of older Americans with presbycusis. In Aim 2, 37 older adults with hearing loss used five methods to select presets. The selection methods were select-by-audiogram, select-by-self-test, select-by-trying, select-by-questionnaire, and random assignment. Using a crossover design, each participant completed speech recognition testing and sound quality ratings in quiet and noise for all selection methods and a verified NAL-NL2 condition. Results The set of presets can fit 67.9% of older Americans with mild-to-moderate hearing loss (Aim 1). Controlling for hearing thresholds and sound quality ratings, liner mixed-effects models indicated that speech recognition scores for select-by-audiogram, select-by-self-test, and select-by-trying were not statistically different from the NAL-NL2 condition. Statistical analysis indicated that select-by-self-test produced outcomes most consistent with individual outcomes for the NAL-NL2 condition (Aim 2). Conclusion This newly developed fitting paradigm may provide efficacy comparable to best-practice verification and could be used in OTC hearing aids."

689,33269360,"Growing attention has been paid to vaccination in control of the COVID-19 pandemic and young adults is one of the key populations for vaccination. Advanced understanding of young adults' willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine and the potential factors influencing their vaccine intention will contribute to the development and implementation of effective strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake among this group. The current study investigated how risk exposures and risk perceptions of COVID-19 (e.g., perceived susceptibility, severity, and fear of COVID-19) as well as negative attitudes toward general vaccination were related to COVID vaccine acceptance among college students based on online survey data from 1062 college students in South Carolina . Hierarchical linear regression was used to examine the association of these factors with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance controlling for key demographics. Results suggested that perceived severity and fear of COVID-19 were positively associated with vaccine acceptance, while higher level of risk exposures (work/study place exposure) and negative attitude toward general vaccination were associated with low vaccine acceptance. Our findings suggested that we need tailored education messages for college students to emphasize the severity of COVID-19, particularly potential long-term negative consequences on health, address the concerns of side effects of general vaccines by dispelling the misconception, and target the most vulnerable subgroups who reported high level of risk exposures while showed low intention to take the vaccine. Efforts are warranted to increase college students' perceived susceptibility and severity and promote their self-efficacy in health management and encourage them to take protective behaviors including vaccine uptake."

Less is known about how personality and peer factors in the first two years of college work together to predict problematic marijuana use and potentially co-occurring academic problems three years later. The longitudinal College Experiences Study (N = 209) was used to address this (N = 209, ~90% white, ~40% male); this study collected data from students in their first year of college, as well as ~1 year later (retention = 85%), and again ~4 years after the initial data collection (retention = 80%). Longitudinal data were analyzed via the traditional cross-lagged panel (CLPM) and the random-intercept CLPM approach. Results were consistent in that there was strong stability in problematic marijuana use, constraint, and antisocial peer affiliation across time, which were predominately influenced by stable, trait-like influences. These factors were also highly correlated but there was less evidence that one predicted the other over time. Nonetheless, greater constraint at Wave 1 was associated with significantly greater cumulative GPA in the transition out of college (βs = 0.43-0.44). Results support the importance of early prevention and intervention of problematic marijuana use, as well as the possibility of using personality-targeted approaches in the first year of college to promote growth in behaviors related to constraint (e.g., staying organized, risk avoidant) in an effort to improve academic success and correlated substance use outcomes by the transition out of college."

These representations are independent of heading direction and allow us to know where we are regardless of our direction of travel. However, we know little about how these location-based representations are formed. Using fMRI representational similarity analysis and linear mixed models, we tracked the emergence of location-based representations in scene-selective brain regions. We estimated patterns of activity for two distinct scenes, taken before and after participants learnt they were from the same location. During a learning phase, we presented participants with two types of panoramic videos: (1) an overlap video condition displaying two distinct scenes (0° and 180°) from the same location and (2) a no-overlap video displaying two distinct scenes from different locations (which served as a control condition). In the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), representations of scenes from the same location became more similar to each other only after they had been shown in the overlap condition, suggesting the emergence of viewpoint-independent location-based representations. Whereas these representations emerged in the PHC regardless of task performance, RSC representations only emerged for locations where participants could behaviorally identify the two scenes as belonging to the same location. The results suggest that we can track the emergence of location-based representations in the PHC and RSC in a single fMRI experiment. Further, they support computational models that propose the RSC plays a key role in transforming viewpoint-independent representations into behaviorally relevant representations of specific viewpoints."

709,33290822,"Almost 40 years ago the first transgenic plant was generated through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, which, until now, remains the method of choice for gene delivery into plants. Ever since, optimized Agrobacterium strains have been developed with additional (genetic) modifications that were mostly aimed at enhancing the transformation efficiency, although an optimized strain also exists that reduces unwanted plasmid recombination. As a result, a collection of very useful strains has been created to transform a wide variety of plant species, but has also led to a confusing Agrobacterium strain nomenclature. The latter is often misleading for choosing the best-suited strain for one's transformation purposes. To overcome this issue, we provide a complete overview of the strain classification. We also indicate different strain modifications and their purposes, as well as the obtained results with regard to the transformation process sensu largo. Furthermore, we propose additional improvements of the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation process and consider several worthwhile modifications, for instance, by circumventing a defense response in planta. In this regard, we will discuss pattern-triggered immunity, pathogen-associated molecular pattern detection, hormone homeostasis and signaling, and reactive oxygen species in relationship to Agrobacterium transformation. We will also explore alterations that increase agrobacterial transformation efficiency, reduce plasmid recombination, and improve biocontainment. Finally, we recommend the use of a modular system to best utilize the available knowledge for successful plant transformation."

711,33292886,"This randomised clinical trial aimed to evaluate the effect of a pro-breast-feeding (BF) and healthy complementary feeding intervention performed during infants' first months of life on ultraprocessed food (UPF) consumption at 4-7 years. We enrolled 323 teenage mothers and their infants from South Brazil, 163 allocated to the intervention group and 160 to the control group. Intervention consisted of sessions on BF and healthy complementary feeding promotion and was carried out in the maternity ward and at home after delivery. Food consumption was assessed using three 24-h food recalls at child's age of 4-7 years. Foods were classified according to NOVA classification. Dietary contribution of UPF was adjusted for intra-individual variability by the SPADE method and categorised into tertiles. We used Poisson regression models with robust variance, adjusted for confounders, to estimate the effect of the intervention and duration of BF on the risk of high consumption of UPF. Our final analysis included 194 children, with mean age of 6·1 (sd 0·5) years. Mean dietary contribution of UPF was 38 % in the intervention group and 42·7 % in the control group, from total daily intakes. Results adjusted for BF duration, propensity score, income and total energy content demonstrated that the intervention reduced the risk of high consumption of UPF by 35 % (relative risk 0·65, 95 % CI 0·43, 0·98). BF duration was not associated with UPF consumption. The intervention was effective in reducing the risk of high UPF consumption at the age of 4-7 years."
712,33294761,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is recommended for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Inadequate suppression of testosterone while on ADT poses a clinical challenge and requires evaluation of multiple potential causes, including adrenal virilizing disorders. We present 2 cases of elderly patients with prostate cancer who had undiagnosed congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) driving persistent testosterone elevation during ADT. The first patient is a 73-year-old man who underwent radical prostatectomy on initial diagnosis and was later started on ADT with leuprolide following tumor recurrence. He had a testosterone level of 294.4 ng/dL and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 17.7 ng/mL despite leuprolide use. Additional workup revealed adrenal nodular hyperplasia, elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone (19 910 ng/dL) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (378 mcg/dL), and 2 mutations of the "

714,33294762,"Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is routinely prescribed in adolescent males with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) or hypogonadism. With many new testosterone (T) formulations entering the market targeted for adults, we review current evidence and TRT options for adolescents and identify areas of unmet needs. We searched PubMed for articles (in English) on testosterone therapy, androgens, adolescence, and puberty in humans. The results indicate that short-term use of  T enanthate (TE) or oral  T undecanoate is safe and effective in inducing puberty and increasing growth in males with CDGP. Reassuring evidence is emerging on the use of transdermal  T to induce and maintain puberty. The long-term safety and efficacy of TRT for puberty completion and maintenance have not been established. Current  TRT regimens are based on consensus and expert opinion, but evidence-based guidelines are lacking. Limited guidance exists on when and how  T should be administered and optimal strategies for monitoring therapy once it is initiated. Only  TE and  T pellets are US Food and Drug Administration approved for use in adolescent males in the United States. Despite the introduction of a wide variety of new  T formulations, they are designed for adults, and their metered doses are difficult to titrate in adolescents. In conclusion, TRT in adolescent males is hindered by lack of long-term safety and efficacy data and limited options approved for use in this population. Additional research is needed to identify the route, dose, duration, and optimal timing for TRT in adolescents requiring androgen therapy."
715,33294765,"Tumor-induced hypoglycemia is a serious disorder most commonly caused by insulinoma or non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH). The hypoglycemia can be severe and refractory to conventional therapy, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. The objective of this work is to describe a series of challenging cases in which refractory, tumor-induced hypoglycemia was shown to respond to the use of pasireotide, a second-generation somatostatin receptor ligand. We describe the clinical and biochemical features of 3 patients with tumor-induced hypoglycemia due to an occult insulinoma, malignant insulinoma, and non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia. In these 3 individuals, the hypoglycemia remained refractory to guideline-recommended medical therapy, such as diazoxide, nonpasireotide somatostatin analogues, and glucocorticoids. Pasireotide was substituted to attenuate the refractory hypoglycemia for each patient. The addition of pasireotide led to prompt improvement in the frequency and severity of hypoglycemic episodes for each tumor-induced hypoglycemia patient. We demonstrate the successful treatment of 3 individuals with refractory, tumor-induced hypoglycemia with pasireotide. We offer the first reported use of pasireotide for the successful treatment of nonmalignant insulinoma and non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia."
716,33298199,"P ingestion has been found to alter energy balance, while regular physical exercise (E) was reported to be associated with energy compensation. However, it is not clear whether dietary P would affect energy compensation following structured E. Two experiments were performed, low P (LP) (0·1, 0·2 and 0·3 %P) and high P (HP) (0·3 , 0·6 and 1·2 %P) diets. In each experiment, male rats were randomly divided into three groups (n 8), in which a sedentary or a moderate-intensity exercise routine (30 min 5 d a week) was implemented. Energy intake (EI); efficiency and stores; body measures and total energy expenditure (TEEx) were monitored for 6 weeks. In the LP experiment, EI and weight gain were the lowest in the 0·1 and 0·2 %P as compared with the 0·3 %P. In the HP experiment, EI was highest in the high P (0·6 and 1·2 %P) groups, while weight gain was reduced. In both experiments, exercise was able to reduce body fat accumulation and to maintain a higher % lean body mass. In the LP diets experiment, the similarity in TEEx between the sedentary and exercising groups suggests the probability of a reduction in normal daily activities, which indicates the presence of compensation for the energy expended during exercise by a subsequent reduction in EE. In contrast, the elevated TEEx in the HP exercising groups (0·6 and 1·2 %P) argue against the presence of energy compensation. In conclusion, high dietary P decreases the body's capability to compensate for the energy deficit induced by E, consequently maintaining an elevated TEEx."
717,33298201,"Lutein is considered as a major biologically active carotenoid, with potential benefits for obesity and cardiometabolic health. This double-blind, randomised controlled trial aimed to assess whether the consumption of lutein along with a low-calorie diet (LCD) can influence anthropometric indices, body composition and metabolic parameters in obese middle-aged individuals. After a 2-week run-in period with an LCD, forty-eight participants aged 45-65 years were randomly assigned to consume 20 mg/d lutein or placebo along with the LCD for 10 weeks. Dietary intake, anthropometric indices, body composition, lipid profile, glucose homoeostasis parameters, NEFA and appetite sensations were assessed at the beginning and end of the study. After 10 weeks, body weight and waist circumference significantly decreased in both groups, although between-group differences were not significant. There was more of a decrease in the percentage of body fat in the lutein group v. the placebo group. Moreover, the placebo group experienced a significant reduction in fat-free mass (FFM), whereas the lutein group preserved FFM during calorie restriction, although the between-group difference did not reach statistical significance. Visceral fat and serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol were significantly decreased only in the lutein group, with a statistically significant difference between the two arms only for TC. No significant changes were observed in the TAG, HDL-cholesterol, glucose homoeostasis parameters, NEFA and appetite sensations. Lutein supplementation in combination with an LCD could improve body composition and lipid profile in obese middle-aged individuals."
718,33298202,"CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide and, after dementia, is the second biggest cause of death for women. In England, it accounts for one in four of all deaths. Lifestyle modifications represent the primary route both to reduce CVD risk factors and prevent CVD outcomes. Diet constitutes one of the key modifiable risk factors in the aetiology of CVD. We investigated the relationship between nine main dietary indices and a comprehensive range of CVD risk factors in 2590 women from TwinsUK. After adjustment for multiple testing, we found that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet was inversely correlated with some of the most common CVD risk factors (BMI, visceral fat (VF), TAG, insulin, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) and atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk) with PFDR ranging from 6·28 × 10-7 to 5·63 × 10-4. Similar association patterns were detected across most of the dietary indices analysed. In our post hoc investigation, to determine if any specific food groups were driving associations between the DASH score and markers of cardiometabolic risk, we found that increased BMI, VF, HOMA2-IR, ASCVD risk, insulin and TAG levels were directly correlated with red meat consumption (PFDR ranging from 4·65 × 10-9 to 7·98 × 10-3) and inversely correlated with whole-grain cereal consumption (PFDR ranging from 1·26 × 10-6 to 8·28 × 10-3). Our findings revealed that the DASH diet is associated with a more favourable CVD risk profile, suggesting that this diet may be a candidate dietary pattern to supplement current UK dietary recommendations for CVD prevention."
719,33298208,"Linoleic acid (LA) is predominantly essential for poultry. Poultry lacking LA show retarded growth and reduced disease resistance. Intestinal barrier function plays an important role in pigeon squab growth, whereas research on the effects of LA on intestinal health in altrices is scant. Considering that squabs are fed by their parents, the study aimed to explore the effects of maternal dietary LA on intestinal morphology, tight junction proteins, immune cytokines and microbial flora in squabs. A completely randomised design with a control group, 1 % LA supplementation group, 2 % LA supplementation group and 4 % LA supplementation group was used. Six squabs from each treatment were randomly sampled at 21 d post-hatching. The results indicated that LA supplementation improved intestinal morphology, as reflected by increased villus height, villus area and the ratio of villi to crypts. Also, 1 % LA supplementation elevated the density of goblet cells in the intestine and strengthened tight junctions by up-regulating claudin-3 and occludin gene expression but down-regulating claudin-2 gene expression. Moreover, 1 % LA supplementation reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and partly increased anti-inflammatory cytokines. The intestinal microbial diversity in the 1 % LA supplementation group was higher than that in the other groups. As beneficial bacteria, Butyrivibrio was the biomarker of 1 % LA supplementation. However, excessive (4 %) LA supplementation led to adverse impacts on intestinal immunity and microbiota. In conclusion, maternal dietary LA might alter intestinal barrier function in pigeon squabs in a dose-dependent manner. Supplementation with 1 % LA was suggested in parental pigeons."
720,33298209,"The present study aims to explore the glucose-lowering effects of the previously characterised dark tea (Camellia sinensis L.) protein extract (DTPE) from Heimaojian on the spleen-brain axis of diabetic mice. DTPE was orally administrated (50-100 mg/kg) to alloxan-induced mice for 21 d; a biochemical assay and transcriptome profiling (RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)) were performed. The results showed that DTPE can improve glucose tolerance. Compared with the model group, at day 21, the fasting blood glucose values were significantly (P < 0·05) decreased by 44·9 % (13·8 v. 7·6 mmol/l) and 51·4 % (13·8 v. 6·7 mmol/l) for high dose of DTPE (100 mg/kg) and drug metformin (125 mg/kg) groups, respectively. Subsequently, transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq) was performed on the spleen and brain of diabetic mice. Totally, fifty-two spleen-derived and forty-seven brain-derived differentially expressed genes related to the synthesis, transport and metabolism of glucose were identified. The regulatory network analysis indicated that DTPE may exert glucose-lowering effects through a thirty-seven-gene sub-network related to metabolism, Parkinson's disease, oxidative phosphorylation and immunity. In summary, for the first time, the present data revealed that dark tea-derived DTPE could exert a potential anti-hyperglycaemic effect by modulating the spleen-brain axis."
721,33298210,"FFQ, the primary method of dietary assessment in large-scale nutritional epidemiological studies, preclude an informed evaluation of the timing of dietary intake and meal-specific dietary intake. In this study, we developed the Meal-based Diet History Questionnaire (MDHQ), a self-administered questionnaire designed for estimating food and nutrient intakes for each meal type separately. The development was done based on a 16-d dietary record obtained from 242 Japanese adults. The MDHQ consisted of the three different parts, with a total of 196 items. Part 1 of the MDHQ asks about consumption frequency of generic food groups (n 24) for each meal type: breakfast, morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner and night snack. Part 2 of the MDHQ asks about relative consumption frequency of sub-food groups within one of the generic food groups which are asked in Part 1. Combining information derived from Parts 1 and 2 enables us to increase the number of foods we can estimate efficiently but within a limited number of questions. Part 3 of the MDHQ asks about general eating behaviours, which are intended to use in a variety of ways during dietary intake calculation. A series of calculation algorithms for food groups, energy and nutrients was also prepared. Given that the MDHQ was empirically developed based on comprehensive information on actual food consumption, this innovative tool may be promising for future epidemiological research on meal patterns and time of day of dietary intake, or chrono-nutrition research. A rigorous evaluation of validity of the MDHQ is warranted."
722,33298213,"To explore the effect of manno-oligosaccharide (MOS) on intestinal health in weaned pigs upon enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88 (ETEC) challenge, thirty-two male weaned pigs were randomly assigned into four groups. Pigs fed with a basal diet or basal diet containing MOS (0·6 g/kg) were orally infused with ETEC or culture medium. Results showed that MOS significantly elevated the digestibility of crude protein and gross energy in both ETEC-challenged and non-challenged pigs (P < 0·05). MOS also elevated serum concentrations of IgA and IgM (P < 0·05), but decreased serum concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 (P < 0·05) in ETEC-challenged pigs. Interestingly, MOS increased villus height and the ratio of villus height:crypt depth in duodenum and ileum (P < 0·05). MOS also increased duodenal sucrase and ileal lactase activity in ETEC-challenged pigs (P < 0·05). MOS decreased the abundance of E. coli, but increased the abundance of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Bacillus in caecum (P < 0·05). Importantly, MOS not only elevated the expression levels of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin-1 and GLUT-2 in duodenum (P < 0·05) but also elevated the expression levels of ZO-1, GLUT-2 and L-type amino acid transporter-1 in ileum (P < 0·05) upon ETEC challenge. These results suggested that MOS can alleviate inflammation and intestinal injury in weaned pigs upon ETEC challenge, which was associated with suppressed secretion of inflammatory cytokines and elevated serum Ig, as well as improved intestinal epithelium functions and microbiota."
723,33298217,"Host-microbial co-metabolism products are being increasingly recognised to play important roles in physiological processes. However, studies undertaking a comprehensive approach to consider host-microbial metabolic relationships remain scarce. Metabolomic analysis yielding detailed information regarding metabolites found in a given biological compartment holds promise for such an approach. This work aimed to explore the associations between host plasma metabolomic signatures and gut microbiota composition in healthy adults of the Milieu Intérieur study. For 846 subjects, gut microbiota composition was profiled through sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in stools. Metabolomic signatures were generated through proton NMR analysis of plasma. The associations between metabolomic variables and α- and β-diversity indexes and relative taxa abundances were tested using multi-adjusted partial Spearman correlations, permutational ANOVA and multivariate associations with linear models, respectively. A multiple testing correction was applied (Benjamini-Hochberg, 10 % false discovery rate). Microbial richness was negatively associated with lipid-related signals and positively associated with amino acids, choline, creatinine, glucose and citrate (-0·133 ≤ Spearman's ρ ≤ 0·126). Specific associations between metabolomic signals and abundances of taxa were detected (twenty-five at the genus level and nineteen at the species level): notably, numerous associations were observed for creatinine (positively associated with eleven species and negatively associated with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii). This large-scale population-based study highlights metabolites associated with gut microbial features and provides new insights into the understanding of complex host-gut microbiota metabolic relationships. In particular, our results support the implication of a 'gut-kidney axis'. More studies providing a detailed exploration of these complex interactions and their implications for host health are needed."
724,33298231,"We aimed to identify the factors influencing child height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) as a measure of child nutritional status in Rwanda, and to examine the role of child feeding and health practices. We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 379 children (aged 6-23 months) and their mothers in northwest Rwanda. Data were collected using a pre-tested, structured questionnaire. An infant and young child feeding practices index (ICFI) and health practices index (HPI) were developed and categorised into tertiles, and linear regression analyses were performed to assess their association with child HAZ. Overall, mothers of non-stunted children exhibited better feeding and health practices than those of stunted children. ICFI was positively associated with child HAZ. We found an adjusted mean HAZ difference of 0·14 between children whose mothers were in high ICFI tertile compared with those in low tertile. Neither HPI nor any of its components were significantly associated with child HAZ. Other factors that were positively associated with child HAZ were infant birth weight (P < 0·001) and maternal height (P < 0·001). Child age, sex (male) (P < 0·05) and altitude (P < 0·05) were negatively associated with child HAZ. Diarrhoea (P < 0·05) and respiratory infections (P < 0·05) were negatively associated with HAZ in younger children aged 6-11 months. Policies to reduce stunting in this population must focus on both pre- and postnatal factors. Appropriate child feeding practices, particularly breast-feeding promotion and improvement in children's dietary diversity combined with measures to control infections should be given priority."

727,33305159,"Adrenal Cushing syndrome during pregnancy is rare, and there is limited information on the effect and safety of metyrapone treatment both for mother and fetus. We present a 24-year-old woman diagnosed with adrenal Cushing syndrome at the end of the second trimester. We elected treatment with metyrapone titrated to 250 mg 3 times daily, resulting in good clinical response and maternal serum and saliva cortisol levels in the upper half of the normal pregnancy range. A healthy male infant was born at 35 weeks' gestation, with no clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency, this despite a low cortisol of 5 nmol/L on the first day of life. We measured metyrapone in maternal and umbilical cord blood samples, demonstrating fetal venous metyrapone levels similar to maternal venous concentration, and a fetal arterial cord concentration at about 60% of the fetal venous cord concentration. This case demonstrates that salivary cortisol levels may be used to monitor the effect of metyrapone on adrenal Cushing syndrome during pregnancy. We show, for the first time in humans, that metyrapone does cross the placenta and may suppress fetal cortisol production without necessarily causing clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency."

729,33305324,"Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder exhibiting alterations in spontaneous and task-related cerebral activity whose relation (termed ""state dependence"") remains unclear. For unraveling their relationship, we review recent electroencephalographic (and a few functional magnetic resonance imaging) studies in schizophrenia that assess and compare both rest/prestimulus and task states, ie, rest/prestimulus-task modulation. Results report reduced neural differentiation of task-related activity from rest/prestimulus activity across different regions, neural measures, cognitive domains, and imaging modalities. Together, the findings show reduced rest/prestimulus-task modulation, which is mediated by abnormal temporospatial dynamics of the spontaneous activity. Abnormal temporospatial dynamics, in turn, may lead to abnormal prediction, ie, predictive coding, which mediates cognitive changes and psychopathological symptoms, including confusion of internally and externally oriented cognition. In conclusion, reduced rest/prestimulus-task modulation in schizophrenia provides novel insight into the neuronal mechanisms that connect task-related changes to cognitive abnormalities and psychopathological symptoms."

732,33305350,Studies suggest that overweight and obese breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of cancer recurrence and have higher all-cause mortality. Obesity has an impact on breast cancer survivor's quality of life (QOL) and increases the risk of longer-term morbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Many cancer guidelines recommend survivors maintain a healthy weight but there is a lack of evidence regarding which weight loss method to recommend.
733,33305693,"Equine infectious disease outbreaks may have profound economic impact, resulting in losses of millions of dollars of revenue as a result of horse loss, quarantine, and cancelled events. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential to limit the spread of infectious diseases. However, laboratory detection of infectious agents, especially the simultaneous detection of multiple agents, can be challenging to the clinician and diagnostic laboratory. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), which allows millions of DNA templates to be sequenced simultaneously in a single reaction, is an ideal technology for comprehensive testing. We conducted a proof-of-concept study of targeted NGS to detect 62 common equine bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens in clinical samples. We designed 264 primers and constructed a bioinformatics tool for the detection of targeted pathogens. The designed primers were able to specifically detect the intended pathogens. Results of testing 27 clinical samples with our targeted NGS assay compared with results of routine tests (assessed as a group) yielded positive percent agreement of 81% and negative percent agreement of 83%, overall agreement of 81%, and kappa of 0.56 (moderate agreement). This moderate agreement was likely the result of low sensitivity of some primers. However, our NGS assay successfully detected multiple pathogens in the clinical samples, including some pathogens missed by routine techniques."

737,33306099,"Malaria begins when Plasmodium-infected Anopheles mosquitoes take a blood meal on a vertebrate. During the initial probing process, mosquitoes inject saliva and sporozoites into the host skin. Components of mosquito saliva have the potential to influence sporozoite functionality. Sporozoite-associated mosquito saliva protein 1 (SAMSP1; AGAP013726) was among several proteins identified when sporozoites were isolated from saliva, suggesting it may have an effect on Plasmodium. Recombinant SAMSP1 enhanced sporozoite gliding and cell traversal activity in vitro. Moreover, SAMSP1 decreased neutrophil chemotaxis in vivo and in vitro, thereby also exerting an influence on the host environment in which the sporozoites reside. Active or passive immunization of mice with SAMSP1 or SAMSP1 antiserum diminished the initial Plasmodium burden after infection. Passive immunization of mice with SAMSP1 antiserum also added to the protective effect of a circumsporozoite protein monoclonal antibody. SAMSP1 is, therefore, a mosquito saliva protein that can influence sporozoite infectivity in the vertebrate host."

739,33306287,"In recent years, minimally invasive surgery has replaced open surgery for almost all surgical indications in gynecological practice. Recently, the results of the laparoscopic approach to cervical cancer (LACC) trial questioned the role of minimally invasive surgery for patients affected by early-stage cervical cancer. In the present paper, we discussed the current evidence regarding the adoption of minimally invasive surgery for patients with cervical cancer. We evaluated the current evidence focusing on four interesting features: 1) the impact of tumor volume; 2) reasons explaining worse outcomes of patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery; 3) methods to reduce the risk of recurrence during minimally invasive surgery; and 4) the effect of minimally invasive surgery in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. At the moment, in the light of current evidence, minimally invasive radical hysterectomy should be offered only in the context of clinical trials. Extensive counseling and appropriate patients' selection are needed. Further prospective evidence is warranted to identify the better approach for cervical cancer patients."

741,33306288,Female age is the strongest predictor of embryo chromosomal abnormalities and has a nonlinear relationship with the blastocyst euploidy rate: with advancing age there is an acceleration in the reduction of blastocyst euploidy. Aneuploidy was found to significantly increase with maternal age from 30% in embryos from young women to 70% in women older than 40 years old. The association seems mainly due to chromosomal abnormalities occurring in the oocyte. We aimed to elaborate a model for the blastocyst euploid rate for patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization/intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) cycles using advanced machine learning techniques.
742,33306289,"Vulvar cancer accounts for ~4% of all gynecological malignancies and the majority of tumors (>90%) are squamous cell (keratinizing, ~60% and warty/basaloid, ~30%). Surgical excision forms the foundation of treatment, with resection margin status being the single most influential factor when predicting clinical outcome. There has been a paradigm shift concerning surgical approaches and radicality when managing vulvar cancer within recent times, largely owing to a desire to preserve vulvar structure and function without compromising oncological outcome. As such the safety of the size of resection margin has been called into question. In this narrative review we consider the current literature on the safety of resection margins for vulvar cancer."
743,33306783,"No approved medication exists for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the United States, which forces patients to utilize off-label drugs and/or create their own formulations. We assessed the efficacy of a standardized compounded fluticasone suspension. To do this, we performed a retrospective cohort study identifying all EoE patients treated with compounded fluticasone. Compounded fluticasone was prescribed during routine clinical care and dispensed by a specialty compounding pharmacy. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. Outcomes (symptomatic, endoscopic, and histologic) were assessed after the initial and last compounded fluticasone treatment in our system. There were 27 included patients (mean age 34.2; 67% male; 96% white) treated for a mean length of 5.4 ± 4.4 months. The majority (89%) previously utilized dietary elimination or topical corticosteroids, and many (75%) had primary non-response or secondary loss of response to these treatments. After starting compounded fluticasone, symptoms and endoscopic findings improved [dysphagia (89 vs. 56%, P = 0.005), food impaction (59 vs. 4%, P = 0.003), heartburn (26 vs. 4%, P = 0.01), chest pain (26 vs. 8%, P = 0.05), white plaques (63 vs. 32%; P = 0.005), furrows (81 vs. 60%; P = 0.06), and edema (15 vs. 4%; P = 0.16)]. The median of the peak eosinophil counts decreased from 52 to 37 eos/hpf (P = 0.10) and 35% of patients achieved <15 eos/hpf. In conclusion, compounded fluticasone provided a significant improvement in symptoms and endoscopic findings, with more than a third achieving histologic response in a treatment refractory EoE population. Compounded fluticasone should be considered as an EoE management option."

746,33307550,"Data on the association of nut intake with risk of cancer and its mortality are conflicting. Although previous meta-analyses summarized available findings in this regard, some limitations may distort their findings. Moreover, none of these meta-analyses examined the dose-response associations of total nut intake with the risk of specific cancers as well as associations between specific types of nuts and cancer mortality. Therefore, this study aimed to summarize available findings on the associations of total nut (tree nuts and peanuts), tree nut (walnuts, pistachios, macadamia nuts, pecans, cashews, almonds, hazelnuts, and Brazil nuts), peanut (whole peanuts without considering peanut butter), and peanut butter consumption with risk of cancer and its mortality by considering the above-mentioned points. We searched the online databases until March 2020 to identify eligible articles. In total, 43 articles on cancer risk and 9 articles on cancer mortality were included in the current systematic review and meta-analysis. The summary effect size (ES) for risk of cancer, comparing the highest with lowest intakes of total nuts, was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.92, P < 0.001, I2 = 58.1%; P < 0.01), indicating a significant inverse association. Such a significant inverse association was also seen for tree nut intake (pooled ES: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.78-0.96, P < 0.01, I2 = 15.8%; P = 0.28). Based on the dose-response analysis, a 5-g/d increase in total nut intake was associated with 3%, 6%, and 25% lower risks of overall, pancreatic, and colon cancers, respectively. In terms of cancer mortality, we found 13%, 18%, and 8% risk reductions with higher intakes of total nuts, tree nuts, and peanuts, respectively. In addition, a 5-g/d increase in total nut intake was associated with a 4% lower risk of cancer mortality. In conclusion, our findings support the protective association between total nut and tree nut intake and the risk of cancer and its mortality."
747,33307861,"Paediatric brain tumour resection rates have been shown to correlate with outcome and, it is argued, are linked to operator volume and caseload. The British paediatric neurosurgery community has previously debated centralisation of paediatric neuro-oncology. At the 2018 British Paediatric Neurosurgery Group (BPNG) meeting, a commitment was made to prospectively collect tumour resection data at each Neurosurgical Unit (NSU). Here we review our prospectively-collected 10-year database of the three commonest paediatric posterior fossa tumours - astrocytomas, medulloblastomas and ependymomas."
748,33308328,"In a previous trial in Mali, we showed that traditional pearl millet couscous and thick porridge delayed gastric emptying (about 5 h half-emptying times) in a normal-weight population compared with non-traditional carbohydrate-based foods (pasta, potatoes, white rice; about 3 h half-emptying times), and in a gastric simulator we showed millet couscous had slower digestion than wheat couscous. In light of these findings, we tested the hypothesis in a normal-weight US population (n 14) that millet foods would reduce glycaemic response (continuous glucose monitor), improve appetitive sensations (visual analogue scale ratings), as well as reduce gastric emptying rate (13C-octanoic acid breath test). Five carbohydrate-based foods (millet couscous - commercial and self-made, millet thick porridge, wheat couscous, white rice) were fed in a crossover trial matched on available carbohydrate basis. Significantly lower overall glycaemic response was observed for all millet-based foods and wheat couscous compared with white rice (P ≤ 0·05). Millet couscous (self-made) had significantly higher glycaemic response than millet couscous (commercial) and wheat couscous (P < 0·0001), but as there were no differences in peak glucose values an extended glycaemic response was indicated for self-made couscous. Millet couscous (self-made) had significantly lower hunger ratings and higher fullness ratings (P < 0·05) than white rice, millet thick porridge and millet couscous (commercial). A normal gastric emptying rate (<3 h half-emptying times) was observed for all foods, with no significant differences among them. In conclusion, some traditionally prepared pearl millet foods show the potential to reduce glycaemic response and promote satiety."
749,33308330,"South Asians, who are at a disproportionately greater risk of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD), represent a rapidly growing population in the USA. The relationship between dairy products, a major component of South Asian diets, and body composition - an established risk factor for ASCVD, is unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine associations between dairy intake and multiple measures of body composition (BMI, waist and hip circumference, waist:hip ratio, abdominal lean mass, subcutaneous, visceral, and intermuscular fat areas) among South Asian adults in the USA. A baseline analysis was conducted using existing data from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America cohort. In women, the highest (>1·9 servings/d) v. lowest (<1 serving/d) tertile of dairy intake was associated with 53 % lower odds of a waist circumference >80 cm (95 % CI 0·25, 0·89, Pfor trend<0·05). No associations were observed between dairy intake and measures of body composition. However, >3 servings of low-fat yogurt/week was associated with a 9·9 cm2 lower visceral fat area (95 % CI -19·07, -0·72, P<0·05) and 2·3 cm2 lower intermuscular fat area (95 % CI -3·76, -0·79, P<0·05) as compared with those with three servings/week. Milk and cheese were not associated with body composition measures. These analyses suggest that higher consumption of low-fat yogurt is associated with lower visceral and intermuscular fat in the whole sample, and women with higher dairy intake have lower waist circumference. Our study supports dietary incorporation of dairy products, and recognises the utility of multidimensional measures of central adiposity."
750,33308344,"The association between dietary Fe intake and diabetes risk remains inconsistent. We aimed to explore the association between dietary Fe intake and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk in middle-aged and older adults in urban China. This study used data from the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study, an on-going community-based prospective cohort study. Participants were recruited from 2008 to 2013 in Guangzhou community. A total of 2696 participants aged 40-75 years without T2DM at baseline were included in data analyses, with a median of 5·6 (interquartile range 4·1-5·9) years of follow-up. T2DM was identified by self-reported diagnosis, fasting glucose ≥ 7·0 mmol/l or glycosylated Hb ≥ 6·5 %. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CI. We ascertained 205 incident T2DM cases during 13 476 person-years. The adjusted HR for T2DM risk in the fourth quartile of haem Fe intake was 1·92 (95 % CI 1·07, 3·46; Ptrend = 0·010), compared with the first quartile intake. These significant associations were found in haem Fe intake from total meat (HR 2·74; 95 % CI 1·22, 6·15; Ptrend = 0·011) and haem Fe intake from red meat (HR 1·86; 95 % CI 1·01, 3·44; Ptrend = 0·034), but not haem Fe intake from processed meat, poultry or fish/shellfish. The association between dietary intake of total Fe or non-haem Fe with T2DM risk had no significance. Our findings suggested that higher dietary intake of haem Fe (especially from red meat), but not total Fe or non-haem Fe, was associated with greater T2DM risk in middle-aged and older adults."
751,33308359,"We aimed to examine whether baseline neutrophil counts affected the risk of new-onset proteinuria in hypertensive patients, and, if so, whether folic acid treatment is particularly effective in proteinuria prevention in such a setting. A total of 8208 eligible participants without proteinuria at baseline were analysed from the renal substudy of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial. Participants were randomised to receive a double-blind daily treatment of 10 mg of enalapril and 0·8 mg of folic acid (n 4101) or 10 mg of enalapril only (n 4107). The primary outcome was new-onset proteinuria, defined as a urine dipstick reading of ≥1+ at the exit visit. The mean age of the participants was 59·5 (sd, 7·4) years, 3088 (37·6 %) of the participants were male. The median treatment duration was 4·4 years. In the enalapril-only group, a significantly higher risk of new-onset proteinuria was found among participants with higher neutrophil counts (quintile 5; ≥4·8 × 109/l, OR 1·44; 95 % CI 1·00, 2·06), compared with those in quintiles 1-4. For those with enalapril and folic acid treatment, compared with the enalapril-only group, the new-onset proteinuria risk was reduced from 5·2 to 2·8 % (OR 0·49; 95 % CI 0·29, 0·82) among participants with higher neutrophil counts (≥4·8 × 109/l), whereas there was no significant effect among those with neutrophil counts <4·8 × 109/l. In summary, among hypertensive patients, those with higher neutrophil counts had increased risk of new-onset proteinuria, and this risk was reduced by 51 % with folic acid treatment."
752,33309242,"Fe(II) interaction with cement phases was studied by means of co-precipitation and sorption experiments in combination with X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. Oxidation of Fe(II) was fast in alkaline conditions and therefore, a methodology was developed which allowed Fe(II) to be stabilised in the sorption experiments and to prepare samples for spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the co-precipitation samples showed uptake of a small portion of Fe(II) by calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H) in the interlayer indicated by an increase in the interlayer spacing. Fe(II) incorporation by AFm phases was not indicated. Wet chemical experiments using "
753,33311601,"Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer mortality in women. Numerous studies have found that the development of CC was associated with multiple genes. However, the mechanisms on gene level are enigmatic, hindering the understanding of its functional roles. This study sought to identify prognostic biomarkers of CC, and explore their biological functions. Here we conducted an integrated analysis to screen potential vital genes. Candidate genes were further tested by experiments in clinical specimens and cancer cell line. Then, molecular modeling was used to predict the three-dimensional structure of candidate genes' proteins, and the interaction pattern was analyzed by docking simulation technique. Among the potential genes identified, we found that TAF1A and ZBTB41 were highly correlated. Furthermore, there was a definite interaction between the proteins of TAF1A and ZBTB41, which was affected by the activity of the p53 signaling pathway. In conclusion, our findings identified TAF1A and ZBTB41 could serve as biomarkers of CC. We confirmed their biological function and deciphered their interaction for the first time, which may be helpful for developing further researches."
754,33311650,"Melanoma is a common lethal skin cancer. Dissecting molecular mechanisms driving the malignancy of melanoma may uncover potential therapeutic targets. We previously identified miR-145-5p as an important tumor-suppressive microRNA in melanoma. Here, we further investigated the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in melanoma. We identified RP11-705C15.3, a regulator of miR-145-5p, as an oncogenic lncRNA in melanoma. RP11-705C15.3 competitively bound miR-145-5p, relieved the repressive roles of miR-145-5p on its target NRAS, upregulated NRAS expression, and activated MAPK signaling. In vitro functional assays revealed that ectopic expression of RP11-705C15.3 promoted melanoma cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, and promoted migration and invasion. Silencing of RP11-705C15.3 repressed melanoma cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and repressed migration and invasion. Notably, the roles of RP11-705C15.3 in melanoma cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion are reversed by miR-145-5p overexpression. In vivo functional assays revealed that RP11-705C15.3 promoted melanoma tumor growth and metastasis, which were also reversed by miR-145-5p overexpression. Furthermore, we investigated the expression of RP11-705C15.3 in clinical melanoma tissues and found that RP11-705C15.3 was increased in melanoma tissues. High expression of RP11-705C15.3 was positively correlated with thickness, ulceration, metastasis, and inferior overall survival. Taken together, our findings suggest RP11-705C15.3 as a novel oncogene in melanoma, and highlight that the RP11-705C15.3/miR-145-5p/NRAS/MAPK signaling axis may be potential therapeutic targets for melanoma."

757,33313679,"The somatostatin receptor 2A (SST2) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed in neuroendocrine tissues within the gastrointestinal tract and brain, and is commonly overexpressed in many neuroendocrine tumors. Moreover, SST2 agonists are used clinically as the primary pharmacological treatment to suppress excess hormone secretion in a variety of neuroendocrine tumors. Despite its wide clinical use, mechanisms controlling the trafficking and signaling of SST2 are not fully understood. SST2 contains a C-terminal post-synaptic density 95, Drosophila discs large, zona-occludens 1 (PDZ) domain-binding motif that has been shown to interact with 3 different PDZ domain-containing proteins. However, the consequences of these interactions are not well understood, nor is it known whether additional PDZ domain proteins interact with SST2. Through unbiased screening we have identified 10 additional PDZ domain proteins that interact with SST2. We chose one of these, SYNJ2BP, for further study. We observed that SYNJ2BP interacted with SST2 in an agonist-dependent manner, and that this required the PDZ binding site of SST2. Importantly, overexpression of SYNJ2BP enhanced ligand-stimulated receptor internalization. Mechanistically, SYNJ2BP interacted with G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and promoted GRK-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor after somatostatin stimulation. Interaction with GRK2 required the C-terminus of SYNJ2BP. Binding to SYNJ2BP did not affect the ability of SST2 to suppress 3',5'-cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate production, but was required for optimal agonist-stimulated extracellularly regulated kinase 1/2 activation. These data indicated that SYNJ2BP is an SST2-interacting protein that modulates agonist-stimulated receptor regulation and downstream signaling."

760,33313749,"Objectives of this study were to evaluate apparent total tract nutrient digestibility and purine derivative (PD) excretion in dairy heifers limit-fed diets containing wet brewer's grains (WBG) treated with salt. A 12-wk replicated 4 × 4 Latin square was conducted using 8 Holstein heifers of 224.5 ± 19.4 d of age, and body weight (BW) of 219.2 ± 28.1 kg (mean ± SD). Fresh WBG were treated with 0%, 0.8%, 1.6%, and 2.4% salt and stored for 4 d before being fed. Salt was added either to the WBG or separately to equalize the amount of salt in the diet. The diet contained 9% grass silage, 47% corn silage, 19% corn meal, 17.6% WBG and salt, 2% soybean meal, and 3% mineral mix. Diets were formulated to be limit-fed at 2.15% of BW, provide 14% crude protein (CP) and 2.27 Mcal metabolizable energy (ME)/kg of dry matter (DM). Heifers were adapted to diets for 14 d followed by a 7-d collection period. Dry matter intake (DMI) was recorded daily during the collection week while BW was recorded once a week. Urine and fecal samples were collected during the last 4 d of the collection period. Acid insoluble ash was used as an internal marker to determine apparent nutrient digestibility. Weight loss of WBG during storage was determined from days 1 to 11 and initial and final yeast and mold counts were determined. Final yeast counts were similar among treatments while final mold counts tended to be lesser (P = 0.07) for the 0.8% and 1.6% salt treatments. Urinary volume was similar among treatments while allantoin (P = 0.14), and uric acid (P < 0.01) and total PD excretion tended to increase (P = 0.13) quadratically. DMI was varied by treatment (linear, quadratic, and cubic effects P < 0.01). Heifers fed the 0.8% treatment had the least DMI. Nonfiber carbohydrate (NFC) digestibility linearly decreased (P < 0.04) as salt increased. Digestibilities of DM, and organic matter (OM), tended to decrease (P < 0.10) with increasing levels of salt added to WBG. Fat digestibility was quadratic with the greatest value for the 1.6% treatment. Treating WBG with salt reduced its deterioration based on lesser mold counts for the 0.8% and 1.6% treatments. These treatments had resulted in greater fat digestibility and tended to have increased PD excretion suggesting improved microbial protein synthesis."
761,33313762,"Claudin-11, a tight junction protein, is indispensable in the formation of the radial component of myelin. Here, we report de novo stop-loss variants in the gene encoding claudin-11, CLDN11, in three unrelated individuals presenting with an early-onset spastic movement disorder, expressive speech disorder and eye abnormalities including hypermetropia. Brain MRI showed a myelin deficit with a discrepancy between T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and some progress in myelination especially involving the central and peripheral white matter. Exome sequencing identified heterozygous stop-loss variants c.622T>C, p.(*208Glnext*39) in two individuals and c.622T>G, p.(*208Gluext*39) in one individual, all occurring de novo. At the RNA level, the variant c.622T>C did not lead to a loss of expression in fibroblasts, indicating this transcript is not subject to nonsense-mediated decay and most likely translated into an extended protein. Extended claudin-11 is predicted to form an alpha helix not incorporated into the cytoplasmic membrane, possibly perturbing its interaction with intracellular proteins. Our observations suggest that stop-loss variants in CLDN11 expand the genetically heterogeneous spectrum of hypomyelinating leukodystrophies."

763,33313795,"Personalized nutrition (PN) behavior-change interventions are being used increasingly in attempts to improve dietary intake; however, the impact of PN advice on improvements in dietary intake has not been reviewed systematically. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of PN advice on changes in dietary intake compared with generalized advice in healthy adults. Three databases (EMBASE, PubMed, and CINAHL) were searched between 2009 and 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tested the effect of PN and tailored advice based on diet, phenotype, or genetic information. The Evidence Analysis Library Quality Criteria checklist was used to conduct a risk-of-bias assessment. Information on intervention design and changes in nutrients, foods, and dietary patterns was extracted from the 11 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, or Europe; reported outcomes on 57 to 1488 participants; and varied in follow-up duration from 1 to 12 mo. Five studies incorporated behavior-change techniques. The risk of bias for included studies was low. Overall, the available evidence suggests that dietary intake is improved to a greater extent in participants randomly assigned to receive PN advice compared with generalized dietary advice. Additional well-designed PN RCTs are needed that incorporate behavior-change techniques, a broader range of dietary outcomes, and comparisons between personalization based on dietary, biological, and/or lifestyle information."
